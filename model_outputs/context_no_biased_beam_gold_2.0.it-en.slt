P 32.85 20.85 32.85 In 1950, while he was eating with some of his physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the Tesla lab, Ricardo, standing still, suddenly took his look off the plate.
P 34.85 20.85 34.85 In 1950, while he was eating with some of his physical colleagues in the soup kitchen at the L'Amos laboratory, and Ricardo, standing still, suddenly looked out of the plate and asked, "Where are you all?"
C 35.54 20.85 35.54 In 1950, while he was eating with some of his physical colleagues in the soup kitchen at the L'House Laboratory, Ricardo, standing still, suddenly looked out of the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?"
P 38.16 36.16 38.16 And he didn't talk about other commensals.
P 40.16 36.16 40.16 And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
C 40.25 36.16 40.25 And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
C 41.57 40.89 41.57 He was crazy.
C 43.55 41.59 43.55 No, he had made a reasoning.

P 75.93 59.93 75.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, very old, that is, long before, on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours.
P 77.93 59.93 77.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, very old, that is, long before, on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced than
P 79.93 59.93 79.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, very old, that was on Earth a long time ago, there could be, in the galaxy, incredibly intelligent species, much older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view.
C 81.91 59.93 81.91 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, much earlier, on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, incredibly intelligent species older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view, millions of years older than us.

C 95.29 92.04 95.29 Here's the question: Where are all of them?
P 98.55 96.55 98.55 And it's something that
P 100.55 96.55 100.55 It's something that can create some curiosity.
C 101.5 96.55 101.5 It's something that can create some curiosity, it can disconcert
