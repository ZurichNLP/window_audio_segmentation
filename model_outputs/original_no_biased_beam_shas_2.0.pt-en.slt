P 89.8058 85.805806 89.8058 When I talk about these experiences, I'm thinking, "What's the solution?
P 91.8058 85.805806 91.8058 I've talked about these experiments that I've been doing, and it's the solution of the new, of six million dollars per year.
P 93.8058 85.805806 93.8058 I've been talking about these experiments because I've been thinking about it, and it's the solution of the new generation, of seven billion dollars per printed run, that nobody knows.
P 95.8058 85.805806 95.8058 When I talk about these experiments, I'm thinking, "What's the solution of the middle, of 70 milligrams per hour, printed, that no one looked at, why is this option?"
P 97.8058 85.805806 97.8058 When I talk about these experiments, I'm thinking, "What's the difference between 70 and 80 milligrams per printed run, which no one chose, and why this option changed most people?"
C 98.8589 85.805806 98.8589 When I talk about these experiments, I'm thinking, "And this is the solution of the middle, of USD 70 million per printed run, that no one chose, why did this option change, did most people choose another one?"
P 102.12 100.12012 102.12 This made me very disconcerted.
P 104.12 100.12012 104.12 This made me very uncomfortable, what I wanted to do with the Arabic language.
P 106.12 100.12012 106.12 This made me very uncomfortable, because I thought, "Will it be that someone else made that decision?"
C 107.227 100.12012 107.227 This made me very uncomfortable, because I thought, "Will it be that other people make that decision?" And I started to study for it.

P 115.788 107.787788 115.788 In memory of this, I find out that this person in the middle has a nickname, it's called Dikhoe, or is it placed in an equation to explain it?
P 117.788 107.787788 117.788 In conclusion, I'll show you that this action has a name, it's called "Dicoe," or is it put into an equation to influence a person's decision?

P 158.633 152.632633 158.633 That's awesome, because I learned how to investigate reggae and everything, in a talk that included D.T.E.
P 160.633 152.632633 160.633 And that's awesome, because I found myself investigating all of this, and in a talk that included DUTT and made it all online.
P 162.633 152.632633 162.633 That's the impression, right? Because I started investigating why all this, and in a talk that included DUTT and made it on the Internet, he made a comparison.
P 164.633 152.632633 164.633 It's printed, isn't it, because I started investigating the reason for all this, and in a talk, including at TEDx and on the Internet, he made a comparison between these two pieces of information.
C 165.606 152.632633 165.606 It's printed, isn't it, because I started investigating why this is all, and in a talk, which included DUTERM and made it on the Internet, it was a talk that made a combination of these behaviors with aesthetic ideas.
P 168.466 166.466466 168.466 I don't know if everyone here is from Rio de Janeiro.

P 176.454 174.454454 176.454 Now, why?
P 178.454 174.454454 178.454 Now, because I had it all around me,

P 258.074 254.074074 258.074 And that's the reason why I'm here today.
P 260.074 254.074074 260.074 And that's why I'm choosing a simple way to give people that choice.
P 262.074 254.074074 262.074 And that's why I'm working on a simple way to make this choice for people: this voice will be the voice of your profession.
P 264.074 254.074074 264.074 And here, while I'm working, I'm exposing a simple way to make people choose: this voice will be a voice for their profession, if the person wants to be a programmer.
P 266.074 254.074074 266.074 And here he was working on a simple way to make choices for people: this voice would be a voice for a profession, and if the person were a speech therapist, they would have these three options.
P 268.074 254.074074 268.074 And that person was working on a simple way to make choices for people: this voice would receive the name of a profession, if the person was a computer programmer, it would read these three options, if the person was a computer, it would read these three options.
C 268.509 254.074074 268.509 And that person was working on a simple way to make choices for people: this voice would receive feedback from a profession; if the person was a programmer, it would read these three options; if the person was a screenwriter, it would read these three options.
P 271.85 269.84985 271.85 At that moment, I came across two options.
P 273.85 269.84985 273.85 At that moment, I started to use this concept as a concept for my magazine.

P 281.85 269.84985 281.85 In those moments, joining this concept with the concept of the magazine "Incoms", it was amazing that there are people who draw the decision-making architecture where I take decisions.

P 286.785 284.784785 286.785 And this generated a lot of cross-function.
P 288.785 284.784785 288.785 This generated a lot of tension in the world of ecology, especially in Brazil.
P 290.785 284.784785 290.785 This led to a great transition: in the world of ecology, I have a new name for my profession, it's called YES.
P 292.785 284.784785 292.785 This led to a lot of transition: in the world of ecology, there's a new name for this profession, it's called IWEX, and the IWRs, the IWR's experience.
C 293.253 284.784785 293.253 This led to a lot of transition: in the world of ecology, there's a new name for this profession, it's called I.E.S. and the U.S.E.R.E.
