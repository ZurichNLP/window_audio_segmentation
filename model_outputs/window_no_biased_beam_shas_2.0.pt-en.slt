P 95.8058 85.805806 95.8058 When I talk about these experiments, I'm thinking, "It's the solution of the "no" of a certain 20,000 dollars per printed run, that no one looked at. Why is this option?"
P 97.8058 85.805806 97.8058 When I talk about these experiments, I'm thinking, "And it's only the option of the "no" of certain 20,000 dollars for the print run that no one chose? Why did this option change the majority of people?"

C 165.606 152.632633 165.606 It's impressive because I've been asked why all this, and in a TEDx talk on the Internet, one of the talks included a combination of these two approaches with multi-ethnic illusion.
P 168.466 166.466466 168.466 Let's see if everyone else can do it.
