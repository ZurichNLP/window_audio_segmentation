C 439.05 437.91 439.05 But how did she look?
P 441.91 439.91 441.91 Because I'm in the "stage of sleep."
P 443.91 439.91 443.91 Because I, while seeing the big pile and the big problem,
P 445.91 439.91 445.91 Because she, while seeing the big pile and the big problems in the world,
P 447.91 439.91 447.91 Because while she saw the big pile and the big problems in the world, she saw what you could do.
P 449.91 439.91 449.91 Because while she saw the big pile and the big problems in the world, she saw what you could do as an individual, slowly.
P 451.91 439.91 451.91 Because while she saw the big pile and the big problems in the world, she saw what you could do as an individual, slowly but surely.
P 453.91 439.91 453.91 Because while she saw the big pile and the big problems in the world, she saw what you could do as an individual, slowly but surely, every day, to change.

P 460.51 458.51 460.51 What exactly is it?
C 460.73 458.51 460.73 Well, what exactly is "Wow"?
P 464.81 462.81 464.81 The idea is really simple.
P 466.81 462.81 466.81 The idea is really simple, and it's a real-life thing.
P 468.81 462.81 468.81 The idea is really simple, and it's something I realized throughout my journey.
P 470.81 462.81 470.81 The idea is really simple, and it's something I realized throughout my journey.
P 472.81 462.81 472.81 The idea is really simple, and it's something I realized throughout my journey: people don't have time, or they simply don't have it.
P 474.81 462.81 474.81 The idea is really simple, and it's something I realized throughout my journey: people don't have time, or are simply not interested enough in working.
P 476.81 462.81 476.81 The idea is really simple, and it's something I realized throughout my journey: people don't have time, or are simply not interested enough, to worry about the environment in an hour.
C 477.24 462.81 477.24 The idea is really simple, and it's something I realized throughout my journey: people don't have the time, or are simply not interested enough, to worry about the environment every day.
P 482.33 480.33 482.33 So...
P 484.33 480.33 484.33 So we proposed to change this.
C 485.48 480.33 485.48 So we proposed to change this question.
P 489.37 487.37 489.37 I live for the "winter biologist" CoRe.
P 491.37 487.37 491.37 If people don't want to be ecological or don't have time, we do it.
P 493.37 487.37 493.37 If people don't want to be ecological, or don't have time, we should think about ecology for them.
C 493.5 487.37 493.5 If people don't want to be ecological, or don't have time, we should think about ecology for them.
P 497.14 495.14 497.14 So, we got the sixth row.
P 499.14 495.14 499.14 So, we got the 6 million "Stanned Stewardships".
P 501.14 495.14 501.14 So, we took the six million "Straight Streams" and went on a journey.
P 503.14 495.14 503.14 So, we took the 600,000 "Stanned Food Trains" and went from one restaurant to the other.
P 505.14 495.14 505.14 So, we took the 600,000 "Stanned Food Trains" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little girls.
P 507.14 495.14 507.14 So, we took the 600 "Straight Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady Steady
P 509.14 495.14 509.14 So, we took the 600 "storage managers" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these small managers as alternatives to single-use boards.
C 509.91 495.14 509.91 So, we took the 600 "storage tubes" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little tubes as alternatives to single-use plastic tubes.
P 516.01 514.01 516.01 So, what's the solution?
P 518.01 514.01 518.01 So, our solution, instead of using them,
P 520.01 514.01 520.01 So, our solution, instead of using this plastic, is to use it.
C 521.94 514.01 521.94 So, our solution, instead of using this plastic, we use a strong steel rod.
P 526.8 524.80 526.8 But I'm sure that plastic
P 528.8 524.80 528.8 But I'm sure that "Single-Use-Plastic" is emerging.
P 530.8 524.80 530.8 But I'm sure that a single-use plastic is much cooler.
P 532.8 524.80 532.8 But I'm sure that a single-use plastic is much cooler than just a single one.
C 533.99 524.80 533.99 But I'm sure that a single plastic use is much cooler than just a single plastic.
P 537.66 535.66 537.66 But plastic is not healthy.
P 539.66 535.66 539.66 But plastic waste and plastic waste serve as a model.
P 541.66 535.66 541.66 But plastic waste and plastic waste serve as a model for everything.
P 543.66 535.66 543.66 But "plastic waste" and "storage waste" serve as a symbol for everything people can do in their daily lives.
P 545.66 535.66 545.66 But plastic and plastic waste serve as a symbol for everything people can do in their daily lives, to live their lives.
C 546.67 535.66 546.67 But plastic and plastic waste serve as a symbol for everything that people can do in their daily lives, to live the most economically possible.
P 551.17 549.17 551.17 (Laughter) (Applause)
P 553.17 549.17 553.17 The other goal is to sustain people.
P 555.17 549.17 555.17 The goal is to make it sustainable.
P 557.17 549.17 557.17 Another goal is to make life sustainable and ecological.
P 559.17 549.17 559.17 The goal is to make a sustainable and ecological life style.
P 561.17 549.17 561.17 The goal is to make a sustainable and ecological life style easier and even smaller.
C 562.46 549.17 562.46 The ultimate goal is to make a sustainable and ecological lifestyle easier and even cheaper than waste water.
C 565.51 564.40 565.51 And I'm convinced.
P 570.97 568.97 570.97 It's the very speed at which plastic flows.
P 572.97 568.97 572.97 It's the speed at which plastic can circulate around the country.
P 574.97 568.97 574.97 It's the speed at which plastic overflows across so many countries.
P 576.97 568.97 576.97 It's the speed at which plastic self-sufficiency has spread throughout the countries, so many countries are talking about plastic self-sufficiency.
P 578.97 568.97 578.97 The speed at which plastic waste is spread throughout the countries - so many countries are talking about plastic waste, even the media.
P 580.97 568.97 580.97 The speed at which plastic waste is spread throughout the countries - so many countries are talking about plastic waste, even the media - is proof that when we collect it,
P 582.97 568.97 582.97 The speed at which plastic waste is spread throughout the countries - so many countries are talking about plastic waste - even the media is proof that when we take action collectively,
P 584.97 568.97 584.97 The speed at which plastic waste is spread throughout the countries - so many countries are talking about plastic waste - even the media is proof that when we collectively take action on our problems, we can do it.
C 585.36 568.97 585.36 The speed at which plastic waste is spread throughout the countries - so many countries are talking about plastic waste - even the media is proof that when we take action collectively on our problems, we can succeed.
P 591.84 589.84 591.84 And honestly, I was really surprised.
P 593.84 589.84 593.84 And honestly, I'm really surprised when I think about this.
C 595.16 589.84 595.16 Honestly, and really surprised, when I think about the impact

P 616.36 598.36 616.36 It took us one year, and today, we are reaching out to three different countries, seven cities, and more than today, 90 restaurants that together with us have decided to create a board of plastics.
C 616.51 598.36 616.51 It took us one year, and today, it has spread to three different countries, seven cities, and more than today, 90 restaurants that, together with us, have decided to build plastic containers.
C 621.79 621.39 621.79 Data, right?
C 625.09 623.25 625.09 I'm not just an interpreter.

P 643.6 641.60 643.6 And I think it's important that you do it.
C 644.59 641.60 644.59 And I think it's important that each one of us

P 687.47 685.47 687.47 I don't really like soccer.
P 689.47 685.47 689.47 It's not very ecological, so try not to do it too soon.
C 689.7 685.47 689.7 I'm not a very ecologist, so I try not to do it too often.
P 692.6 690.60 692.6 For you to turn on this map.
P 694.6 690.60 694.6 But you go back to the top and you forget about it.
