P 154 130.0 154 But to take all the people who are victims of sex trafficking as if they were the victims of sex exploitation as a whole, the research has shown that in Portugal, the phenomenon of sex trafficking is not very expressive, they are phenomena that we can identify with, but that can be sexual.

P 470 468.0 470 It's a process of healing, and it's not only that.
P 472 468.0 472 It's a process of healing, and it's not just looking for healthy things.
P 474 468.0 474 It's a process of healing, not only by looking for healthy people, but also by getting involved.

P 486 468.0 486 And it's not just looking for life in a healthy way, but also getting involved in your healing process, in the decisions you make. To do this, the first and most important point is information, not just what Dr. Google says, which is in fashion.
P 488 468.0 488 And it's not just looking for health insurance, but also getting involved in the healing process, the first and most important point is information, not because we're talking about Dr. Google, who isn't in fashion when I was a child.
P 490 468.0 490 And it's not just about looking for health insurance, but also to get involved in your healing process, the first and most important thing is information, not just because Dr. Google is not in fashion, when you were a child you had this kind of care, but also medicine and health insurance.
P 492 468.0 492 And it's not just looking for health insurance, but also getting involved in the decision-making process of your cure. The first and most important thing is information. Don't forget that Dr. Google, who's not in fashion, when he was a child, had a book about health insurance.
C 494 468.0 494 It's not just about looking for health care, and the most important thing is to get involved in the process, the first step in the doctor's process is information.

P 502 494.0 502 The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone to publish something, to have an editor, to sell...
P 504 494.0 504 (Laughter) The difference was that, at that time, to convince someone to publish something, to have an editor, to sell, you had to have the content to talk.
P 506 494.0 506 (Laughter) The difference that, at that time, to convince someone to publish something, to have an editor, to sell, you had to have content to say, "Today, like Google, you have a huge market.
P 508 494.0 508 (Laughter) The difference with that, in order to convince someone to publish something, to be an editor, to sell, you had to have the content to say, "Today, like Google, you have a wealth of information.
P 510 494.0 510 (Laughter) The difference was that, at that time, in order to convince someone to publish something, to be an editor, to sell, you had to have the content to say, "Today, like Google, you have a lack of information, many of them very good and very bad."

P 518 494.0 518 The difference, at that time, in order to convince someone to publish something, to be an editor, to sell, nowadays, like Google, you have an infinity of information, many of them very good and very important, but many very bad, and we need to know how to filter, the capacity to generate information is bigger than the cost.
C 520 494.0 520 (Laughter) The difference, at that time, in order to convince someone to publish something, to be an editor, to sell, you had to have the content to say, "Today, like Google, you have an abundance of information, many of them very good and very important, but many are very bad, and we need to know how to filter, the capacity to generate information is greater than the capacity to filter."

P 528 520.0 528 We have to think about it in terms of information. First, good information is usually signed, and I have a problem.
P 530 520.0 530 We have to think about this at the beginning of our lives. First of all, good news is usually a bad news. I have a blog, in my blog "Something".
P 532 520.0 532 We have to think about it. First of all, about bad information, which is usually condemned. I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of the time.

P 542 520.0 542 People have to think about this, and they say, "First, in São Paulo, São Paulo is usually applauded. I have a blog, and only 1.3 percent of the people on my blog talk about who I am, and that gives me a lot of anger, because people hear what I have to say and don't know what I did, what I studied.
P 544 520.0 544 People have to think about this: first, in São Paulo, I have a blog, and in my blog only about 1.3 percent of people think I am, because people get there, hear what I have to say, and don't know what I did, what I studied, and it doesn't matter to me, because it's wrong.
C 546 520.0 546 People have to think about it in their childhood. First of all, in their childhood, they say, "Well, I have a blog, in my blog, about 3% of the people can find out who I am, and this gives me a lot of satisfaction, because people hear what I have to say, and don't know what I did, what I studied, and it doesn't hurt me at all, it doesn't hurt me, it's the same as the other person."

C 572 546.0 572 There are many people defending their personal interests, making money, selling medicines, or other things like that. The second important thing is, don't believe in conventional or relational medicines. Now, your problems have generally ended.

P 634 624.0 634 When you say you're a doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine is for, you have the right to know what the risk of that surgery is, there's no way you can say, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have the time."
P 636 624.0 636 When you say you're a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, you have the right to know what the risk is in that surgery, you don't have to say, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to listen to me, I've been working for 20 years."
P 638 624.0 638 When you say you're a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, the risk of that surgery, you don't have to say, "Oh, public hospital, man, I don't have time to understand, I've been working for 20 years, I know I've had little time."
P 640 624.0 640 When you say you're a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, the risk of that surgery, there's no need to say, "Oh, public hospital, man, I don't have time to listen to me, I've been working for 20 years, I know I don't have enough time, don't you think you're changing the day and night?"
P 642 624.0 642 When you talk about being a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, if you have the right to know the risk of that surgery. There's no need to say, "Oh, I don't have time to attend a public hospital, I've been working for 20 years, I know I don't have much time, I don't know if it's going to change from day to night, but I don't have to change the culture."
P 644 624.0 644 When you talk about being a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, if you have the right to know the risk of that surgery. There's no need to say, "Oh, public hospital, man, I don't have time to listen to me, I've been working for 20 years, I know I don't have time, but I don't know if it's going to change from day to night, but the culture doesn't have to change."
P 646 624.0 646 When you talk about being a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, if you have the right to know the risk of that surgery.

P 648 624.0 648 When you talk about being a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, if you have the right to know what the risk of that surgery is. I don't know if you've been working at the hospital for 20 years or so. I don't know if you're going to change from day to night, but I don't have to change the culture. The culture of demanding isn't coming here, fighting with everyone for help, isn't that?
C 650 624.0 650 When you talk about being a doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine is for, if you have the right to know what the risk is in that surgery. There's no need to say, "Oh, I don't know if you'll work from day to night, but I don't have to change the culture of the hospital, the culture of demanding, it's not coming here, fighting with everyone for the medicine, it's not this, it's just a random thing."
P 652 650.0 652 (Laughter)
P 654 650.0 654 But demand, if we put together with time, we have one.
P 656 650.0 656 But if we need to adjust with time, we'll have to adapt with care.
P 658 650.0 658 But if we have to adjust with time, we'll have to make the attendances different.
P 660 650.0 660 But if we have to adjust with time, we'll have to make the treatments different. Doctors want to treat them differently.
P 662 650.0 662 But if we have to adjust with time, we'll have to make the care different: doctors want it, they want it to be right, they don't want it to be wrong.
P 664 650.0 664 But if we take time, we'll make the care different: Doctors want it, they want to have it right, they don't want to have it expensive, they want it within an hour.
P 666 650.0 666 And if we have to adjust with time, we'll have to make the treatments different: Doctors want to be treated, they want to be treated right, they don't want to be treated with expensive drugs, they want to be treated with Kalashnikov.
P 668 650.0 668 And if we have time, we'll make the treatments different, the doctors want it, they want to get it right, they don't want it to be expensive, they want it to be done with care.
P 670 650.0 670 And if we put together with time, we'll make the services different, the doctors want to have the right, they don't want to have expensive services at an hour, they want to have a call. Once I was in the Amazon, right in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro,
P 672 650.0 672 And if we put together time, we'll make the attendances different: the doctors want to attend right, they don't want to be expensive, they want to attend with care. Once I was in the Amazon, right in the Amazon area, the monotonous area, the inhumane area.
P 674 650.0 674 And if we make up time, we'll make the attendances different: doctors want to attend right, they don't want to be expensive, they don't want to attend with call. Once, when I was in the Amazon, right in the middle of it, in the monotonous area, and we had a patient there.
C 676 650.0 676 And if we put together a time frame, we'll make it different: doctors want to treat people on the right, they don't want to treat people on the left, they don't want to treat people on the right, they don't want to treat people on the left. Once, when I was in the Amazon, right in the Amazon area, right in the Amazon area, right in the Amazon area, right in the Amazon area, right in the Amazon area, right in the Amazon area, right in the Amazon area, right in the Amazon area.

C 702 676.0 702 I had a tumor in my chest, and there was no oncologist, so we brought him to São Paulo. It was an Indian who didn't speak Portuguese to be treated, and obviously he didn't speak Portuguese at the time of the exams. After I had the opportunity to see a translator for all the children, who spoke very good Portuguese, and they were very bad, he was obviously scared.

P 730 728.0 730 I have a completely different culture.
P 732 728.0 732 Because he had a completely different culture than the other, he gave his soul to that one.

P 28 26.0 28 This is the only decision we have to make.
P 30 26.0 30 I'll make a decision, I hope you've decided to devote your time to this talk.

P 40 26.0 40 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my way of making decisions. It's an experiment that was done with this magazine.
P 42 26.0 42 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I looked at one of the decisions, it changed my way of making decisions, it's an experiment that was carried out by the magazine Da Vinci.
P 44 26.0 44 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I thought about making decisions, it changed my way of thinking about making decisions. It's an experiment that was carried out by the magazine in the past.
P 46 26.0 46 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I looked at one of the decisions, changed my way of making decisions. It's an experiment that had an effect on the magazine from then on. The magazine's members had three notions of this nature: a digital structure,
P 48 26.0 48 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I looked at decision-making, it changed the way I thought about making decisions, it changed the way I thought about making decisions, it changed the way I thought about making decisions, it was an experiment that had the effect of changing the way I thought about making decisions, it was an experiment that had the effect of changing the way I thought about making decisions, it was an experiment that had the effect of changing the way I thought about making decisions, it was an experiment that had the effect of changing the way I thought about making decisions, it was an experiment that had the effect of changing the way I thought about making decisions, it was an experiment that had the effect of changing the way I thought about making decisions.
P 50 26.0 50 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I looked at one of the decisions, changed the way I looked at the magazine from time to time. It's an experiment that had the effect of changing the magazine's style. The magazine had three new features: a digital format at 59 hours, and a magazine format in print.
C 52 26.0 52 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I looked at one of the decisions, it changed the way I looked at the magazine from time to time. It's a magazine experiment that had three features: a digital format at 59 dollars, a print magazine format at 75 dollars, and a website.
P 54 52.0 54 In reality, it's like digital plus.
P 56 52.0 56 Our culture is like digital plus print, as well as digital plus digital plus print.
P 58 52.0 58 Our culture is like digital plus print, through different kinds of things.
P 60 52.0 60 The difference is that the majority of people don't know how to use a digital printer.
P 62 52.0 62 The difference is that the vast majority of people chose how they want to learn.
P 64 52.0 64 It's not like "digital plus print," but "digital plus print," for example. The result of this difference is that the vast majority of people chose "digital plus print for USD 5."
P 66 52.0 66 It's not like "digital plus print", but "digital plus print", and the sphere of this exercise is that the vast majority of people chose the egg for USD 3500.
P 68 52.0 68 The lab is a digital plus print company, as well as a small print company. The sphere of this difference is that the vast majority of people chose the egg for 35 dollars. What I really like about these experiments is that they usually have two euros.
P 70 52.0 70 The lab is a digital plus print company, and also a small print company. The result of this exercise is that the vast majority of people chose to buy a small dollar for their food. What I really like about these experiments is that there are usually two groups.
P 72 52.0 72 "Digital plus print" is like "Digital plus print" as well as "Species of dollars." The result of this exercise is that the vast majority of people chose "O" for "Species of dollars." I like these experiments a lot, because generally, there are two groups, but for the second group, only two options were offered.
P 74 52.0 74 The second group had only two options: (English) The first group had only two options, (English) the second one had only two options, (English) the third one had two options, (English) the fourth one had two options, (English) the fifth one had two options.
P 76 52.0 76 In fact, the technology is like digital plus print, as well as smart toys. The result of this experiment is that the vast majority of people chose to use smart toys. Generally, there are two types of toys: for the second group, only two options were offered: one is digital plus toys, and the other is smart toys.
C 78 52.0 78 The thing about this experiment is that the vast majority of people chose to buy <i>digital plus print</i> for 200 dollars. For the second group, only two options were offered: the digital plus 500 dollars option and the buy-up option for 200 dollars as well.
P 80 78.0 80 (Applause) And what's interesting?
P 82 78.0 82 And what interested me was that I came to this group of people:
P 84 78.0 84 And for this group of people, the majority chose the digital option.
P 86 78.0 86 (Video) Narrator: And for this group of people, the majority chose the digital option.
P 88 78.0 88 And for this group of people, the majority chose a digital option: when they talk to me about these experiments,
P 90 78.0 90 And my interesting thing is that, for this group of people, the majority chose a digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments, I'm thinking, "What's the solution?
P 92 78.0 92 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option, when they talk to me about the experiments they're doing, and the choice between two options: (English) or (English)
P 94 78.0 94 And my interesting thing is that, for this group of people, the majority chose the digital option, when they talk to me about these tools they're thinking about, and the medium-sized solution, the printed version, nobody looks at it.
P 96 78.0 96 And my interesting thing is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about these tools they're thinking about, and the medium-sized solution, the printed version, that no one chose, why did they choose this option?
P 98 78.0 98 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about these things that I'm thinking about, and the choice of using the printed version, which no one chose, why did this option change most of them?
P 100 78.0 100 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about the experiments I've been doing, and the choice of using printed balloons, which no one chose, why did this option change? Most of them chose one option.
P 102 78.0 102 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option, and when they tell me about it, they say, "I'm thinking about it," and the option is printed, "Nobody chose it," because this option changed, most of them chose one, and that made me very uncomfortable.
C 104 78.0 104 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option, and when they tell me about the experiments they're doing, and the choice between two options is printed, that no one changed, most of them chose one option, and this left me very uneasy, why am I going to move forward?
P 106 104.0 106 What would I have done with that decision?
P 108 104.0 108 What would have made me make that decision?
P 110 104.0 110 I made this decision, and I started to study about it, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered this is the reality of the world.
P 112 104.0 112 I had to make this decision, and I started to study about it, I studied a lot about it, and I found out that this action has a name, it's called ADHD.
P 114 104.0 114 I learned from this decision, and I started to study about it, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this person in the middle has a name, it's called Dico, it's the name of the person in the middle.
P 116 104.0 116 I learned from this decision, and I started to study about it a lot, and I discovered that this person's half name, it's called Decathlon, or is it put in an equation to influence people?
P 118 104.0 118 I started to study this, and I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this medium-sized person, with a nickname, is called a coel, or is it placed in an equation to influence a person's decision?
P 120 104.0 120 I started to study about this, and I discovered that this half name, it's nicknamed "coyote," or it's put in an equation to influence a person's decision.
P 122 104.0 122 I learned a lot about this, and I discovered that this medium-sized company, with its name, can be used in an equation to influence a decision, and I learned a lot about this in a theory called "Made by Me."
P 124 104.0 124 I learned a lot about this, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this medium-sized solution has a name, or that it's put in an equation to influence a decision or another, and I learned a lot about this in a theory called the academic theory, or the real-life theory.
P 126 104.0 126 I learned a lot about this, I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this medium-sized neuron, with its name, can be used in an equation to influence one decision or another, and I learned a lot about this from a theory called the cognitive biology theory.
P 128 104.0 128 I learned a lot about this, I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this medium-sized scale coel can be placed in one equation or another to influence a decision, and I learned a lot about this from a theory called "coelogical economy" or "coelogical technology," the theory that studies coelogical biology and neuroscience applied to mathematics.
C 130 104.0 130 I learned a lot about this, and I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this medium-sized coel can be used in one decision or another, and I learned a lot about it in a theory called "edecology" or "travel theory," a theory that studies cognitive biology and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
P 132 130.0 132 It's interesting, you're watching this video.
P 134 130.0 134 It's a little paper, it's interesting, you might use it, but it's really interesting.
P 136 130.0 136 It's a little paper, it's interesting, you can see it there, but you have two options.
P 138 130.0 138 It's a little paper, it's interesting, you can use it, but you have two options for ID, and you want people to choose what they want.
P 140 130.0 140 It's interesting, you can use it, but you have two options for ID, and you want people to choose the one you like.
P 142 130.0 142 It's interesting, you can use it, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the iPad: You're young or you're less good at it.
P 144 130.0 144 It's interesting, you could use it, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the iPad: You're young, or you're less good at it, or you're not good at it.
P 146 130.0 146 It's interesting, you can use it, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the iPad: You're a teenager, you're less good at it, it's the iPad that makes you look better, for those who don't like it.
P 148 130.0 148 It's interesting, you could use it, but you've got two options, and you want people to choose whether to be a teenager or not, it's that if you're less happy, it makes you feel better, so that you'll always pay more than two dollars in your pocket.
P 150 130.0 150 I'll give you some information, but you may have two options, and you want people to choose Sunset, if you're young, or if you're less good than Sunset, it makes Sunset look better for those who will always pay USD 5,000 in a printed edition, if I can have it online.
P 152 130.0 152 (Laughter) It's interesting, you could use it, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the one that's less good for you, the one that makes the smartphone look better, so that those who are going to pay for USD 25 in a press release can have two options on the iPad.
P 154 130.0 154 (Laughter) I'm going to give you some information, but you can see that you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose between the two: (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause)
C 156 130.0 156 (Laughter) I'm going to give you a little bit of information, but you can see that you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the iPad: you want it to sound good every time, for those who spend less than 25 dollars on it, or it's less printed, you can have two for those who don't. (Laughter) (Applause) This is printed on black and white, because I can question the reason for all this.
P 158 156.0 158 I'll give you a talk.
P 160 156.0 160 And in a talk that included YouTube and made it all available online.
P 162 156.0 162 In a talk, DuTé included me and made it all available on the Internet.
P 164 156.0 164 And in a talk, DuTé included me and made it all available on the Internet, and in a talk, he made a comparison between these two camps.
P 166 156.0 166 And a talk that included Deutsche Telekom and made an Internet connection, was a talk that made a comparison between these behaviors and the ones of the utopians.
P 168 156.0 168 In a talk, including at TEDx, I made a comparison between these two types of behavior with the ones in the US. I thought everyone was in the US.
P 170 156.0 170 And a talk, including one from DUTERM, that made it interesting, was a talk that made him make a comparison between these two types of behavior. I think everyone is part of the DUTERM cycle.
P 172 156.0 172 And in a talk, including one from TEDx, I made a comparison between these implementations and the ones from IoT. I think everyone shares the same opinion about IoT. The blue to the left circle seems a little different.
P 174 156.0 174 In a talk, including DUTERM, I made a comparison between these implementations and the ones from the USA. I think everyone shares the same idea: the blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right.
P 176 156.0 176 And in a talk, including at TEDx, I made a comparison between these two types of behavior: I think everyone shares the idea that the blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right, don't you agree?
P 178 156.0 178 And in a talk, including "The Theater" and "Interest," a talk made a comparison between these two types of behavior. I think everyone agrees that the blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right.
P 180 156.0 180 And in a talk, including at the TEDx event, I made a comparison between these two types of diagrams. I think everyone agrees that the blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. Because I have around me, it makes us see things differently.
C 182 156.0 182 And in a talk, which included Deutsche Telekom and made it interesting, there was a talk in which he made a comparison between these two diagrams with the diagram of Deutsche Telekom. I think that the blue circle looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. I agree, because I have it around me, and it makes us see things differently.
P 184 182.0 184 But we don't see him coming.
P 186 182.0 186 But we see it with a different perspective, and we have it around us.
P 188 182.0 188 But we see it as an interference that has an influence on us.
P 190 182.0 190 But we see it as an interference because it has an influence over us, and another ideological influence because it makes us act as we do.
P 192 182.0 192 Well, we see it as an interference, because it can influence us; having another ideological illusion, because it can make us feel better when we see it, which is this one here.
P 194 182.0 194 Well, but we can see that it has an influence on us, that it has another influence on us, that it has another European influence, that it makes it easier to see when I see it, which is here, in the shows of the Chariot from above.
P 196 182.0 196 But we see it in a different way because it can influence us, in a different way because it makes it easier to see when I see it, which is this: the pieces of the table above are the same as the pieces of the table below.
P 198 182.0 198 Well, but we see it in a different way because it has an influence over us, and it has another European influence because it makes it easy to see when I see it, which is here: the pieces of the lower chess pieces are the same as the pieces of the lower chess pieces.
P 200 182.0 200 Well, but we see it in a different way because it has an influence on us, in a different way because it makes it easy to see when I see it, which is this: the pieces of t-shirt from above are the same as the pieces of t-shirt from below.
P 202 182.0 202 (Laughter) But we see it in a different way because it has an influence on us, and it has another influence in Europe, because what makes it easy to see when I see it is this: the pieces of chalk from above are the same as the pieces of chalk from below. At this point, the equinox says, "Hey, there's a problem in the time I get there."
P 204 182.0 204 (Laughter) But we see it in a different way, because it has an influence on us, and it has a different perspective, which is easy to see when I see it here: the parts of the bottom and the top are the same, the parts of the bottom and the top are the same. It's at this point that the other side says, "I have a problem with the way I deal with this, but I'll show you this."
P 206 182.0 206 Well, we see it in a different way, because it has an influence on us, and it has a different ideology, which makes it easy to see when I see it here, which is: "The pieces of t-shirt are the same as the pieces of t-shirt from below." It's at this point that I'm going to tell you, "I've got a problem with the way I deal with this, but I'll show you what it is."
C 208 182.0 208 Well, we see it in a different way, because it has an influence on us, it has another influence on us, it has another influence on us, because what happens when I see it is that the pieces of the diagram below are the same, the pieces of the diagram above are the same, the pieces of the diagram below are the same. It's in this moment that I see him saying, "I have a problem with the way I deal with this, but I'll show you what it is like to read," without any characteristics.
P 210 208.0 210 In the pieces, it's all about deep thinking.
P 212 208.0 212 In the parties, it's only when we think deep down that we see that they're really good.
P 214 208.0 214 In parties, it's only when we think deep down that we see that they are really good.
P 216 208.0 216 In the shows, we only have to see deep down that they are really good guys.
P 218 208.0 218 When I saw this presentation, I really understood it and said,
P 220 208.0 220 In the plays, we only see them deep down, we see they're really cool. When I see this presentation, I really understand and it makes some sense to say what's around them.
P 222 208.0 222 In the plays, we only see them deep down, we see they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, it really made sense to say that what's around us has an influence on us.
P 224 208.0 224 In the plays, we only see them deep down, we see they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood and it makes sense to say what's around us, what influences us, the real perspective that's around us.
P 226 208.0 226 When you look at the pieces from the bottom, you can see they're really cool. When I see this presentation, it really makes sense to say that what's around us influences us, from the very first point of view that's around us, influences the way people see things.
P 228 208.0 228 When we look at the pieces from the bottom, we see that they are really beautiful. When I see this presentation, it really makes sense to understand what is around us, what influences us, from the very first point of view that influences us, to the point that we see things, what is around us doesn't really make sense to us.
P 230 208.0 230 When I saw this presentation, it really made sense to us to understand what is influencing us, from the first point of view, to the point where we see things, what is influencing us is also the basis of all our decisions.
P 232 208.0 232 In the plays, we only have to think deep, we see that they're really good for us. When I saw this presentation, it really made us understand what has an influence around us, from the very first point of view that has an influence over the way we see things, what has an influence over the way we make decisions.
C 234 208.0 234 In the pieces, we only have to think deep, we see that they are really good. When I saw this application, it really made sense to us to understand what it has to do around us. From the very first point of view that influences things, what it has to do around us also has a lot to do with decision-making, the work of technology, and it was the day he was working on a project.
P 236 234.0 236 It's a project to create a publication.
P 238 234.0 238 It's a project to create a publication about security.
P 240 234.0 240 We had a project to create a publication about security, and we thought that security was difficult.
P 242 234.0 242 We're going to create a publication about security, because security is difficult, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to explore them.
P 244 234.0 244 We're going to create a publication about security, and we're going to improve security, it's difficult, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to exploit them.
P 246 234.0 246 We'll be able to create a publication through these signals, and we'll be able to improve the rigor, it's difficult, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to use them, whether they're the 2 or the 3 or the 2 options.
P 248 234.0 248 We're going to have to create a way to communicate with people, and we're going to have to understand that rigor is difficult, there's a lot of options, and we won't be able to use them.
P 250 234.0 250 We'll be able to create a publication through security, we'll be able to improve security, it's difficult, there's a lot of options we won't be able to use for it, whether it's using the options, the two, the three, or the two, and in a second security event we'll be working on it.
P 252 234.0 252 We're going to create a publication through "Security." We're going to have a hard time, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to choose one, two, three, or two. If we can choose one, two, three, or two, and at a certain event, we're going to work on it, they're going to have 500 and 11 employees.
P 254 234.0 254 We're going to create a publication through "Security." We're going to have a difficult grade, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to choose one, two, three, or two. If we choose one, two, three, or two, and at a certain event, we were working on it, we had 501 options.
P 256 234.0 256 It's a project to create a publication on security. We're going to be faced with a very difficult security issue, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to choose one, two, three, or two. If we choose one, two, three, or four options, we'll be sure that in one event, we'll be working on it, we'll have 511 options, and here, in the morning, it'll be available.
P 258 234.0 258 It's very difficult for us to create a publication about security, because it's very hard for us to choose between these two options. If we choose one, two or three, we'll be safe. And in a certain event, we were working on it, there were 511 possibilities of choice, and here we're choosing a simple way.
C 260 234.0 260 It's a very difficult choice for us to make, and we won't be able to choose between these three or two options, and in a certain event, we were working on the possibility of choice, and here, in this talk, we were choosing a simple way of choosing for people.
P 262 260.0 262 This way, we decided to have another profession.
P 264 260.0 264 This way, they'll find another profession, if the person wants to do this program.
P 266 260.0 266 This way, she would find another profession: if she was a programmer, she would give her these three options.
P 268 260.0 268 This way, she would find another profession: if she was a programmer, she would give her these three options; if she was a mechanical engineer, she would give her these three options.
P 270 260.0 270 This way, she came up with another profession: she thought of being a programmer, she would give her these three options, she thought of being a mechanic, and she came up with these three options.
P 272 260.0 272 This voice brought him to another profession: if he was a programmer, he would give him these three options; if he was a mechanic, he would give him these three options.
P 274 260.0 274 This voice led him to another profession: if he was a programmer, he would give him these three options; if he was a mechanic, he would give him these three options.
P 276 260.0 276 This voice led him to another profession: if he was a programmer, he would give him these three options; if he was a mechanic, he would give him these three options.
P 278 260.0 278 This woman brought him another profession, she would teach you this program, she would teach you these three options, she would teach you mechanics, and she'd teach you these three options. It was then that I added this concept to the concept of the magazine, and I realized that there are people.
P 280 260.0 280 This voice led him to another profession, to this software, and gave him these three options: to be a mechanic, and to see these three options. It was then that I joined this concept with the concept of the magazine, and I realized that there are people who design architecture.
P 282 260.0 282 This voice led him to another profession, to this photogrammer, to these three options, to this mechanic, and to these three options. It was then, along with this concept of the magazine, that I realized that there are people who make drawings of decision-making architecture, where I ask questions.
P 284 260.0 284 This voice led him to another profession: if he was a photographer, he would give him these three options: if he was a mechanic, and he would give him these three options. It was then, along with this concept of the magazine, that I realized that there are people who draw the architecture of decisions, where I ask for decisions.
C 286 260.0 286 This voice led me to another profession, to this photogrammer, she would give me these three options, this person would be a mechanic, and she would give me these three options. It was at that moment, along with the concept of the magazine, that I realized that there are people who make drawings of the decision-making architecture, where I make decisions, and this caught my attention.
P 288 286.0 288 In the world of technology, right?
P 290 286.0 290 In the world of ecology, they add a name and a profession.
P 292 286.0 292 In the world of ecology, there's a new name for this profession, it's called I.E.S. and I.E.R.E.
P 294 286.0 294 In the world of ecology, there's another name for this profession, it's called I.E.S. and the U.S.E.R., the user's experience.
P 296 286.0 296 In the world of ecology, there's a long way to go for this profession, it's called "eo-ex" and the e-spirers, the user's experience, are the people who are the users.
P 298 286.0 298 In the world of ecology, it's still a long way to go for this profession, it's called I.E.S. and the eSpirers, the user's experience, are the architects of the decisions.
P 300 286.0 300 In the world of ecology, there's still a long way to go for this profession, it's called I.E.S. and the users' experience, which are the architects of the decisions, they work with this decision-making architecture, they design.
P 302 286.0 302 In the world of ecology, there's another name for this profession, it's called Y.E.S. and the users' experience, which are the architects of the decisions, they work with this decision-making architecture, designing all the format and the software.
P 304 286.0 304 In the world of ecology, there's also a name for this profession, it's called Y.E.S. and the users' experience, which are the architects of the decisions, they work with this decision-making architecture, designing all the format and the environments in which we make decisions.
P 306 286.0 306 In the world of ecology, there's no name for this profession, it's called Y.E.S. and the users' experience, which are the architects of decisions, they work with this decision-making architecture, designing all the format and the environments where we make decisions.
P 308 286.0 308 In the world of ecology, there's no longer a name for this profession, it's called Y.E.S. and the users, the user's experience, are the real architects of decisions, they work with this decision-making architecture, designing all the format and the environments for us to make decisions.
P 310 286.0 310 In the world of ecology, there's no longer a name for this profession, it's called I-X, and the users, the user's experience, are the people who work on this decision-making architecture, designing all the format and the environments for decision-making. (Laughter) Because there's a book that looks like a friend of mine, "Today, you met this guy."
C 312 286.0 312 In the world of ecology, there's no longer a name for this profession, it's called I-X, and the users, the user's experience, are the architects and decision makers, who work with this architecture, which looks like a friend of mine. Today, he's found a day with this guy, Escala da Terra Leni.
P 314 312.0 314 There's a person who's a Burundian.
P 316 312.0 316 Is there a person who is a Burundian in this particular situation?
P 318 312.0 318 There are people who are bullied at some point in their lives, and my friend and I said, "Look at this."
P 320 312.0 320 There are people who are bullies at this point in time, and my teacher said, "Look at the person I met who wasn't free."
P 322 312.0 322 The person who's a guru at that time, when I went to the bar, said, "Look how I found the one who wasn't cold, and I told him about these terrible things."
P 324 312.0 324 The person who's a hooligans at that time, when I was in contraction, and he and my teacher said, "Look how I found those who aren't happy, and I told them these are the theories that you have to bring to knowledge."
P 326 312.0 326 The person who's a hooligans at this point in time, and he and I, on my other side of the street, said, "Look how I found the guy who's not a hooligans," and I told him, "This is the theory that you have to bring the knowledge of the behavioral economy to the digital world."
P 328 312.0 328 There's a person who's a bug in this area when I go online, and he and I, in this photo, said, "Look at who I found who wasn't happy, and I told him about this theory that you have to bring the knowledge of behavioral economy to the digital world, and he's really passionate about it."
P 330 312.0 330 There's a person who's a hooligan at this point of view, and he and I, in this photo, said, "Look at who I met who wasn't happy, and I said to him, "This theory is that you have to bring the knowledge of behavioral economy to the digital world," and he said, "He's super fascinated, he's going to get a degree."
P 332 312.0 332 There's a person who's a hooligan in this area of the world, and he and I, in this photo, said, "Look at who I found, who's not ugly, and I told him you have to bring the knowledge of behavioral economy to the digital world, and he's very passionate about it, he's going to be a superhero, and he's going to have a nice time with him."
P 334 312.0 334 There's a person who's a big fan of this topic when I go online, and he and I, in this photo, said, "Look at the fact that I met him, he's not ugly, and I told him you have to bring the knowledge of behavioral economy to the digital world, and he's super fascinated, he wants to start with Superman Blade, and have a great deal with her," which really changed the way we looked at each other.
P 336 312.0 336 He's a guy who's a big fan of behavioral issues, and he and I, in this photo, said, "Look at the fact that I found out that he's not ugly, and I told him you have to bring the knowledge of behavioral issues to the digital world." He said, "You have to bring the knowledge of behavioral issues to the digital world." He said, "You have to bring the knowledge of behavioral issues to the digital world." He said, "You have to bring the knowledge of behavioral issues to the digital world." What changed a lot in my life was that we saw behavioral issues.
C 338 312.0 338 There's a person who's a big fan of behavioral issues, and he and I, in this photo, said, "Look that I found out that you're not fed up, and I told him you have to bring your knowledge of behavioral issues to the digital world, and he's going to be a great fan of behavioral issues." (Laughter)
P 340 338.0 340 I think we need to do research.
P 342 338.0 342 I think we don't need any research to know that we use a lot of neurons.
P 344 338.0 344 I think we didn't need to do any research to know that we used a lot of cell phones, that everyone was wearing them.
P 346 338.0 346 I think we don't need to do any research to know that we use a lot of cell phones, that everyone wants to use a cell phone in their pocket, or out of their pocket.
P 348 338.0 348 I think we don't need to do any research to know that we use a lot of cell phones, that everyone wants to wear a cell phone, a bag, or look at it, but it's a big deal.
