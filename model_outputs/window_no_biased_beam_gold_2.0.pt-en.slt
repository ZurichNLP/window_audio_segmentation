P 16.44 14.44 16.44 And these numbers are just a little bit of an idea.
P 18.44 14.44 18.44 This number is the number of decisions a month are made.
C 18.78 14.44 18.78 This number is the number of 8 out of 10 decisions a month are made in Brazil.
P 21.36 19.36 21.36 You make more or less the same decision every time.
C 22.56 19.36 22.56 It would take more or less one decision every two seconds.
C 23.42 22.89 23.42 And that's it.
P 25.42 23.42 25.42 Just one, two, you need one.
C 26.72 23.42 26.72 One, two, you make a decision.
C 28.92 27.07 28.92 To be sure, the audience was very excited.
P 31.96 29.96 31.96 The word "decision" counts for the process.
P 33.96 29.96 33.96 Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you about a story that happened to me.
P 35.96 29.96 35.96 Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my mind. One of the decisions changed my mind.
C 37.24 29.96 37.24 Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my mind. When one of the decisions arrived, it changed my mind to make decisions.
P 40.02 38.02 40.02 The fake news was made with the magazine.
C 40.72 38.02 40.72 The first one was made with the magazine, right now.
P 43.46 41.46 43.46 The cities in the list had three main ones.
P 45.46 41.46 45.46 The cities on the list had three types of structure.
P 47.46 41.46 47.46 The cities of Rio de Janeiro had three types of cities: a digital city with 50 million inhabitants, and a rural city with 100 million inhabitants.
P 49.46 41.46 49.46 The magazine's cities had three types of structure: a digital structure with 59 dollars, and a magazine structure with 25 dollars.
P 51.46 41.46 51.46 The magazine's cities had three grades: a digital grade with 59 dollars, and a print magazine grade with 72 dollars.
P 53.46 41.46 53.46 The magazine's cities had three categories: a digital category with 59 dollars, a printed magazine category with 72 dollars, and a category that is like "generation."
P 55.46 41.46 55.46 The magazine's cities had three grades: a digital grade at USD 59; a print magazine grade at USD 625; and a grade that is more like digital printing. There is also a series of grades.
C 56.34 41.46 56.34 The magazine's cities had three categories: a digital category at USD 50, a printed magazine category at USD 62, and a category that is more like "digital printing," as well as some "seritis" categories.
P 58.9 56.90 58.9 On the other side of this meter, it's the big one.
P 60.9 56.90 60.9 On the other hand, the vast majority of people chose
C 62.86 56.90 62.86 And one of the benefits of this tool is that the vast majority of people chose the little dollar.
P 66.01 64.01 66.01 I like these experiments a lot.
P 68.01 64.01 68.01 If I like these experiments a lot, it's because they usually have two sides.
C 68.04 64.01 68.04 If I like these experiments a lot, it's because they usually have two sides.
P 70.51 68.51 70.51 But the second one is the fluorine.
P 72.51 68.51 72.51 For the second group, only two options were offered.
P 74.51 68.51 74.51 But for the second group, only two options were offered: the digital and the urban.
P 76.51 68.51 76.51 For the second group, only two options were offered: the idea of a 50-year-old digital talk and the idea of a computer program.
C 77.84 68.51 77.84 For the second group, only two options were offered: the digital option with US$ 54 and the buy option with US$ 55.
P 81.25 79.25 81.25 This is interesting for this group of people.
P 83.25 79.25 83.25 Interestingly, for this group of people, the last day they chose the option.
C 84.05 79.25 84.05 Interestingly, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option.
P 87.78 85.78 87.78 Everybody who talks about these experiences is listening.
P 89.78 85.78 89.78 I'm all talking about these experts thinking, "It's all about money."
P 91.78 85.78 91.78 I'm talking about these experiments, and it's the solution of the "no" of a certain amount of money.
P 93.78 85.78 93.78 I'm talking about these experiments because I'm thinking, "It's the solution of the "no" of some 20,000 dollars, according to the press, that no one has ever heard of."
C 94.37 85.78 94.37 I've been talking about these experiments, thinking, "It's the solution of the middle, of a certain amount of USD 20,000 for the print run, that no one looked at."
P 96.83 94.83 96.83 Why did this choice change?
P 98.83 94.83 98.83 Why did this choice change, did most people choose another?
C 98.84 94.83 98.84 Why did this choice change, did most people choose another?
P 102.28 100.28 102.28 And it was very shocking.
P 104.28 100.28 104.28 It left me very disconcerted, because the one who gave me the most, the one who gave me the most.
C 105.36 100.28 105.36 It left me very puzzled, because who else would I be if I made this decision?
C 107.33 105.76 107.33 And I started studying about that.
P 109.73 107.73 109.73 I'm going to tell you a little about it.
C 110.76 107.73 110.76 Thank you very much. (Applause)
C 112.39 111.39 112.39 What do you mean by that?
P 114.8 112.80 114.8 It's an overlapping equation.
P 116.8 112.80 116.8 It's not necessary to be overlaid in the equation to influence the person.
C 118.49 112.80 118.49 It's a tool that's overlaid in an equation to influence a person's decision.
P 121.33 119.33 121.33 And I liked this a lot, but I didn't have a name for it.
C 122.89 119.33 122.89 I've learned a lot about this, and I don't think it's the same thing as a drug dealer.
P 125.03 123.03 125.03 It's a theory that differs from ours.
P 127.03 123.03 127.03 I'll talk to you about cognitive studies, and I'll talk to you about this.
C 128.88 123.03 128.88 It's a theory that studies cognitive law, and God knows how to make decisions.
P 131.55 129.55 131.55 There's even a little paper, it's interesting.
P 133.55 129.55 133.55 I'll give you a little leaflet. It's interesting, you'd like to use it.
P 135.55 129.55 135.55 I'll give you a little sheet of paper. It's interesting, you should use it, but you have two options.
P 137.55 129.55 137.55 I'll give you a little sheet of paper. It's interesting, you should use it, but you have two options, and you want people to make choices.
C 138.78 129.55 138.78 I'll give you a little sheet of paper. It's interesting, you could use it, but you have two options for AD, and if you want, people choose option T.
P 141.44 139.44 141.44 I think it's less good.
C 141.61 139.44 141.61 If you're a kid, you're less good at school.
P 144.35 142.35 144.35 This is the same thing, it does the same thing.
C 145.23 142.35 145.23 This is the one that makes the baby look better.
P 147.25 145.25 147.25 I'm going to talk to about 130 students.
P 149.25 145.25 149.25 to pay USD 125 to your company, if you can.
C 151.25 145.25 151.25 For you to pay USD 115, in your printing house, if I can have two first pages?
C 153.67 152.59 153.67 And that's what happened at night.
P 155.69 153.69 155.69 Because I was interested in that.
P 157.69 153.69 157.69 Why did I write all this? And in a talk, I said, "Why?"
P 159.69 153.69 159.69 Because I loved to ask why all this, and in a TED talk I included it and made it all interesting.
C 159.91 153.69 159.91 Because I popped up and asked why all this, and in a talk, I included a tennis player and made it all interesting.
P 162.62 160.62 162.62 At the time, he was doing a comparison.
P 164.62 160.62 164.62 When I was a high school student, he collaborated with these behaviors.
C 165.62 160.62 165.62 When I was a high school student, I made a combination of these behaviors with the rest of my life.
P 168.43 166.43 168.43 I don't know if you're all from Rio de Janeiro.
C 168.56 166.43 168.56 Let's see if everyone else can do it.
P 171.24 169.24 171.24 The guy with the left handkerchiefs.
P 173.24 169.24 173.24 The little blue guy looks a little bigger than the little blue guy.
C 173.93 169.24 173.93 The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right.
C 175.02 174.40 175.02 Now?
P 178.16 176.16 178.16 Because I've come back.
P 180.16 176.16 180.16 Because I've come back, so we can see things differently.
C 180.34 176.16 180.34 Because I've come back, so we can see things differently.
P 182.69 180.69 182.69 I had already bought 22 tons.
P 184.69 180.69 184.69 I'll give you some notes, but the script is a bit like that.
C 186.47 180.69 186.47 Actually, they're saying, "No, but we can see some kind of stereotype around influencers."
P 189.21 187.21 189.21 And there's another ideological idea, which is to make a difference.
P 191.21 187.21 191.21 There's another ideological lesson that you can learn from YouTube, which is this one.
P 193.21 187.21 193.21 There's another ideology that makes you laugh at YouTube, which is this one.
P 195.21 187.21 195.21 There's another ideological lesson that you can learn from YouTube, and it's this one. The pieces on the top are the same.
C 196.99 187.21 196.99 There's another ideological lesson that you can learn from YouTube, and it's this one: the pieces of t-shirt above are the same as the pieces of t-shirt below.
P 200.32 198.32 200.32 I'm an expert in cultural affairs and I'll talk to you about it.
P 202.32 198.32 202.32 At that point, the referee says, "No, I have the problem with the shape."
C 202.81 198.32 202.81 At that point, the audience says, "I have a problem with the way all this works."
P 205.52 203.52 205.52 It shows you that it's the same.
P 207.52 203.52 207.52 It shows you that it's read, without words.
P 209.52 203.52 209.52 It shows a process that is read, without being dedicated to parties only.
P 211.52 203.52 211.52 show the process that it's fair. Without being dedicated to parties only, we can see that they're really good.
C 212.52 203.52 212.52 show the process that it's fair. Without being dedicated to parties, we only see that they are really fair.
P 216.43 214.43 216.43 When I saw this pre-rehearsal,
P 218.43 214.43 218.43 I've just seen this dress, and it makes you feel better.
P 220.43 214.43 220.43 When I see this question, I really understand it, and it makes sense to say that what's around the table makes sense.
C 221.05 214.43 221.05 When I saw this presentation, I really understood it, and it makes sense to say that what's around the light bulb makes sense.
P 223.43 221.43 223.43 In the same way, what's involved is fluidizing.
P 225.43 221.43 225.43 In the same way, what's involved in influencing the way people see things?
P 227.43 221.43 227.43 In the same way, what's around influencing the way people see things, what's around influencing the way people think.
C 228.51 221.43 228.51 In the same way, what's around influencing the political scene, things, what's around influencing all the decisions.
P 231.39 229.39 231.39 It's a work in the technology industry.
P 233.39 229.39 233.39 and technology, and it's not the same for those who are still working.

C 237.32 229.39 237.32 Technology, and a friend who was working on a project to create a population through security.
C 239.53 237.55 239.53 And here it is for the different writing.
P 241.94 239.94 241.94 There's a lot of options, and I'm going to talk about them.

P 245.16 243.16 245.16 Do you want to study second or third grade?"
P 247.16 243.16 247.16 I'm going to show you some dots, some strings, some dots, and some light.
P 249.16 243.16 249.16 I chose the second options, the third one, the second one, and the third one, safe.
P 251.16 243.16 251.16 I chose the second, the third, the second, and on the third side, safe, which was at work, they said, "501."
P 253.16 243.16 253.16 I collaborated in the second, the third, and the second ones, and in the third safe haven, where I was working, there were 51 options.

P 258.02 254.02 258.02 I'm going to talk to you in a simple way.
C 259.53 254.02 259.53 And here's where I'm going to show you a simple way to give people this choice.
P 261.93 259.93 261.93 This is the voice of my profession.
C 262.2 259.93 262.2 This way, they'll get the same as your profession.
P 264.47 262.47 264.47 I'll show you all the rules, she'll read it.
P 266.47 262.47 266.47 (Laughter) (Applause)
P 268.47 262.47 268.47 The voice of the whole program would read these three ears. The voice of the first screen would read these three ears.
P 270.47 262.47 270.47 The person who voted for the program would read these three ears. The person who voted for the first screen would read these three options.
P 272.47 262.47 272.47 The person you're talking about will read these three sounds. The person you're talking about will read these three options. It was at that moment, when I joined these three voices, that I realized that I had a dream.
P 274.47 262.47 274.47 If you talk to a person, they'll read these three sounds. If you're a screenwriter, they'll read these three options. Was these moments, along with this possibility, the main purpose of the magazine?
P 276.47 262.47 276.47 If the person you're talking about would read these three sounds, if the person you're talking about would read these three options?
P 278.47 262.47 278.47 If you talk to someone, they'll read these three sounds. If you look at the screen, they'll read these three options. It was at those moments, together with the concept of this magazine, that I noticed that there are people who say,
P 280.47 262.47 280.47 If you talk to someone, they'll read these three sounds. If you're a screenwriter, they'll read these three options. It was at that moment, together with this magazine's TEDxPhone concept, that I learned that there are people who design architecture and design design design.
P 282.47 262.47 282.47 you talk, she'll read these three sounds. If you look at the screen, she'll read these three options. It was at that moment, along with this opportunity, with the concept of the magazine, that I noticed that there are people who make drawings of decision-making architecture, where I'm taking the decisions that I want to make.
P 284.47 262.47 284.47 you talk, she'll read these three options. If you look at the screen, she'll read these three options. It was at that moment, along with this opportunity to learn about the concept of the Cuban magazine, that I noticed that there are people who make drawings of the decision-making architecture where I make my own decisions.
C 286.2 262.47 286.2 If you talk to someone, they'll read these three options. If you're a screenwriter, they'll read these three options. It was at these moments, together with this talk about the concept of the Cuban magazine, that it was amazing to see that there are people who design the decision-making architecture where I make decisions. This called me a lot.
P 288.71 286.71 288.71 The world of ecology is expanding.
C 289.64 286.71 289.64 In the world of ecology, there's still a long way to go.
P 291.9 289.90 291.9 And what about the breaths?
C 293.28 289.90 293.28 It's called "EX." And the "spirers" are the user's experience.
P 295.72 293.72 295.72 It's done through people who are people.
P 297.72 293.72 297.72 But exactly the people who are the architects make the decisions.
P 299.72 293.72 299.72 There are actually people who are the architects of the decisions, who work in the architecture of the decisions.
P 301.72 293.72 301.72 But there are also people who are the architects of the decisions. They work to enjoy the architecture of the decision, designing everything in shape and shape.
C 303.65 293.72 303.65 But most of the people who are the architects of the decisions work on the architecture of the decisions, designing all the shapes and the airplanes making all the decisions.
P 307.29 305.29 307.29 I'd like it to look like mine.
P 309.29 305.29 309.29 I'd like to compare myself to someone like me, soon to find a day to celebrate.
P 311.29 305.29 311.29 I'd like to share it with a friend of mine: Soon he found a day with this guy, this guy, "Dear, right?"
