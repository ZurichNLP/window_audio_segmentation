P 28 26.0 28 in the lab of the physicists.
P 30 26.0 30 at the lab of Los Alamos, and Eric Fermi, in the lab of the lab.
P 32 26.0 32 Physicists at the lab at Los Alamos. Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly looked up.
P 34 26.0 34 Physicists at the Alemão lab. Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly took his eyes off the plate and asked:
P 36 26.0 36 of physicists at the Alemão lab, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly took his look off the plate and asked, "Where are all of you?" He asked, "Where are all of you?"
P 38 26.0 38 Physicists in the room in the lab of Los Angeles, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly looked at him from the plate and asked, "Where are you all?" He didn't talk about the other commentaries.
P 40 26.0 40 at the lab at the Aleppo, Henry, standing firm, suddenly took his eyes off the plate and asked, "Where are all of you?" He wasn't talking about the other comets, he was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
P 42 26.0 42 at the lab's table, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly looked out of the plate and asked, "Where are all of you?" He didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was crazy, right?
P 44 26.0 44 of physicists in the room in the lab of Los Angeles. Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly looked up from the plate and asked where everyone was. He didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was crazy. No, he had made a thought.
P 46 26.0 46 in the lab's room. Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly looked up from the plate and asked where everyone was. He didn't talk about the other comets. He was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was impatient. No, he had made a point. In our galaxy, there are two galaxies.
P 48 26.0 48 of physicists in the lab's room, Henrique Fierro, suddenly took his look from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?" He didn't talk about the other comensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was crazy, he had made a thought. In our galaxy there are hundreds of billions of planets, and there are millions of planets.
P 50 26.0 50 in the lab's room. Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly took his look from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?" He didn't talk about the other comensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was terrified. He had a thought. In our galaxy, there are hundreds of billions of stars, most of them older than us.
C 52 26.0 52 of physicists in the room in the lab of Los Angeles. Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly looked up from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?" He wasn't talking about the other comensals. He was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was crazy. He was thinking. In our galaxy, there are hundreds of billions of stars. Most of them are older than our Sun.
P 54 52.0 54 The oldest ones are 13.
P 56 52.0 56 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun.
P 58 52.0 58 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old.
P 60 52.0 60 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old.
P 62 52.0 62 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. Well, then, if life had appeared,
P 64 52.0 64 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. So, if life had disappeared on some other planet?
P 66 52.0 66 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. So, if life had disappeared on some other planet, around one of these stars?
P 68 52.0 68 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, that is, much earlier.
P 70 52.0 70 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, that is, on Earth, much earlier, it would have been
P 72 52.0 72 the oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are four and a half billion years old. So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which was on Earth a long time ago, it could exist in the galaxy, especially on Earth.
P 74 52.0 74 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are four and a half billion years old. So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, that was on Earth a long time ago, there could be, in the galaxy, incredibly intelligent species.
P 76 52.0 76 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, very old, so long before, that were on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours.
C 78 52.0 78 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. Well, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, very old, so much earlier on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced than ours.
P 80 78.0 80 Technological?

P 96 78.0 96 from a technological point of view, with millions of years ahead of us, we might already be traveling between the stars, but we have never been contacted by any of these hypothetical intelligent civilizations. And from here the question: "Where are all of them?"
P 98 78.0 98 from a technological point of view, with millions of years ahead of us, we might already be traveling between the stars, but we have never been contacted by any of these hypothetical intelligent civilizations. And from here, the question, "Where are all of them?" is something that, in short, is very important.
P 100 78.0 100 from a technological point of view, with millions of years ahead of us, we might already be traveling between the stars, but we have never been contacted by any of these hypothetical intelligent civilizations. And from here, the question, "Where are all of them?" is something that can create some kind of
P 102 78.0 102 from a technological point of view, with millions of years of advantage over us, we might already be traveling between the stars. And yet, we have never been contacted by any of these hypothetical intelligent civilizations. And from here, the question, "Where are all of them?" is something that can create some curiosity, can be puzzling, and, in fact, it's a question that I've never asked myself.
C 104 78.0 104 from a technological point of view, with millions of years of advantage over us, we might already be traveling between the stars, but we have never been contacted by any of these hypothetical intelligent civilizations. And from here, the question, "Where are all of them?" is something that can create some curiosity, it can be puzzling, and in fact, over the years, I've been asked, "Where are all of them?"
P 106 104.0 106 I've tried many approaches for this.

P 112 104.0 112 I've tried many approaches to answer this question, many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the most interesting one is the question:
P 114 104.0 114 Many approaches have been tried to answer this question, many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there.
P 116 104.0 116 many approaches have been tried to answer this question, many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.

P 120 104.0 120 many approaches have been tried to answer this question, many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone. So, this is possible. I think this is a question we have to ask ourselves.
P 122 104.0 122 many approaches have been tried to answer this question, many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone. This is possible. I think this is a question that we have all asked ourselves before and after.

This is possible. I think this is a question that we have all asked ourselves, at least in life. I have always asked myself when I was a kid.
P 128 104.0 128 many approaches have been tried to answer this question, there have been many possible answers, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone. This is possible. I believe that this is a question that we have all asked ourselves. Later on, in life, I've been asking myself this question since I was a child, when I was watching a starry sky.
C 130 104.0 130 have tried many approaches to answer this question, there have been many possible answers, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone. This is possible. I believe that this is a question that we have all asked ourselves in our lives, at least I have always done it. When I was a child, when I looked at a starry sky, I asked myself if, around the sky, there was a star, if there was a star, if there was a star, if there was a star, if there was a star.
P 132 130.0 132 What about those bright spots?
