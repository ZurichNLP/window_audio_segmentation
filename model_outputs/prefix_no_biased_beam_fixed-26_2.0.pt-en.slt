P 32 26.0 32 I'm going to make a decision, I hope I've made it right now. I'm going to tell you a decision.
P 34 26.0 34 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed my life.

P 38 26.0 38 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I arrived at one of the decisions, the way I took the decisions.
P 40 26.0 40 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of making decisions. These were the first steps that were taken by the
P 42 26.0 42 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of making decisions. It's a first that was done by the magazine in the past few years.

P 46 26.0 46 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you something that changed my way of making decisions. It's a first that was done with the magazine, and today, the magazine's fans have three new ideas of this nature: a digital
P 48 26.0 48 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of making decisions, one of the first ones that came to my mind with the magazine. The magazine's headquarters had three new ideas of this nature: a digital
P 50 26.0 50 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of making decisions. It changed my way of making decisions. The magazine's headquarters had three options of this kind: a digital edition at 59 hours, a magazine edition, or printing.
C 52 26.0 52 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of making decisions. One of the first things that changed my way of making decisions was that the magazine's headquarters had three options of this kind: a digital one at 59 dollars, a print one at 75 dollars, and a
P 54 52.0 54 In reality, it's like digital plus
P 56 52.0 56 In Nature, it's like digital plus print, and it's also
P 58 52.0 58 In Nature, it's like "digital plus print" for seven and a half dollars.
P 60 52.0 60 The difference is that the vast majority of people who don't know how to read or write,
P 62 52.0 62 The difference is that the vast majority of people chose how they want to live their lives.
P 64 52.0 64 The difference is that the vast majority of people chose how to buy for USD 25 or more.
P 66 52.0 66 The difference between the price of the toothpaste and the price of the toothpaste itself is that the price of the toothpaste is higher than the price of the toothpaste itself.
P 68 52.0 68 The difference is that the vast majority of people chose how to eat for 25 dollars. What I enjoy most of these experiments is that they generally cost 2 dollars.
P 70 52.0 70 The difference is that the vast majority of people chose how to eat for 75 dollars. What I enjoy most of these experiments is that I usually have two euros. But for a second in the group,
P 72 52.0 72 The difference is that the vast majority of people chose how to eat for USD 5. Because I enjoy these experiments, I usually play two games, but for the second group, only two options were offered.
P 74 52.0 74 The second group had only two options: a digital game, or a video game, or a video game.
P 76 52.0 76 In the second group, only two options were offered: a digital option with US$ 5, and a digital option with US$ 6,
C 78 52.0 78 The challenge of this experiment is that the vast majority of people chose to buy for USD 500. For the second group, only two options were offered: the digital option for USD 500 and the buying option for USD 500.
P 80 78.0 80 (Applause) And what interested me
P 82 78.0 82 And what interested me was that here, for this group of people, the biggest
P 84 78.0 84 And what's interesting is that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital hearing.
P 86 78.0 86 And what interested me was that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital
P 88 78.0 88 And what interested me was that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option: when I talk about these experiments, I want to
P 90 78.0 90 And what interested me was that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option: when they talk to me about this experiment, I'm thinking, "What's the solution?"
P 92 78.0 92 And what's interesting is that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option: when they talk to me about this experiment I've been doing, and it's the solution, in the middle, of
P 94 78.0 94 And what interested me was that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option: when they talk to me about these experiments that I've been doing, and it's the solution, in the middle, of 60 millimeters per impression, that no one
P 96 78.0 96 And what interested me is that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments that I've been doing, and it's a half-way solution of 60 millimeters per printed volume, that no one chose, why did they choose this option?
P 98 78.0 98 And what's interesting is that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about the tools they're using, and the option of a printed label, which no one chose, why has this option changed most people?
P 100 78.0 100 And what's interesting is that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about the examples I've been rehearsing, and the solution in the middle, which is to serve people with printed balloons, nobody chose it, why did this option change, did most of them choose one?
P 102 78.0 102 And what's interesting is that here, for these groups of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about the examples I've been studying, and the image, the image, that no one chose, why did this option change? Most of them chose one, and this made me very uncomfortable.
C 104 78.0 104 And what's interesting is that here, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about the examples I've been studying and the image of the environment, that no one changed, why did most of them choose a different one? And this left me very disconcerted, because I wanted to
P 106 104.0 106 When I arrived at my decision, I
P 108 104.0 108 When I made this decision, I started studying about it.
P 110 104.0 110 I made this decision, and I started to study about it, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this
P 112 104.0 112 I made this decision, and I started studying about it, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this person has even a name,
P 114 104.0 114 I made this decision, and I started studying about it, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this person has a name, it's called Dicoy, it's the person who
P 116 104.0 116 I made this decision, and I started studying about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this action, and even the name, it's called "coaching," it's the action that is put into an equation to influence
P 118 104.0 118 I learned a lot about this decision, and I started studying about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this half name, it's called "coyoe," the notion that's put in an equation to influence when a person makes a decision or
P 120 104.0 120 I learned a lot about this decision, and I started studying about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this half name of the action, it's called "coyote," the action that's put in an equation to influence a person in making one decision or another.
P 122 104.0 122 I've learned a lot about this, and I've studied it a lot, and I've discovered that this half-meaning action, it's called "coaching," it's the action that's put into an equation to influence a person's decision, and I've learned a lot about this in an theory called "the self-man."
P 124 104.0 124 I've learned a lot about this, and I've studied a lot about it, and I've discovered that the idea of the middle name is to be put in an equation to influence a person in one decision or another, and I've learned a lot about this in a theory called "economy", like the
P 126 104.0 126 I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economics and Technology, which studies cognitive ecology.
P 128 104.0 128 I learned a lot about this, and I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this half-man thing, it's called "coyote," it's about being put in one equation to influence one decision or another, and I learned a lot about this with a person called economist or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist, or economist.
C 130 104.0 130 I learned a lot about it, and I discovered that this half-meaning function, it's to be put in one equation or another, and I learned a lot about it to influence a person's decision with the theory that studies cognitive ecology and neuroscience applied to decision-making.

P 140 130.0 140 It's interesting, you can see it there, but the brain has two ADL options, and you want people to choose the ADL option, you're a
P 142 130.0 142 It's interesting, you could use it, but the brain has two ADR options, and if you want it, and people choose the ADR option, you're a youngster and the ADR option is less good.
P 144 130.0 144 It's interesting, you can see it, but MMS has two options and you want people to choose the option T. You're a youngster or you're less good at it.
P 146 130.0 146 It's interesting, you can use it, but MMS has two options, and you want people to choose the option B. You're a youngster, the option C. It's just that if you're the same age, you'll be better.
P 148 130.0 148 It's interesting, you can use it, but MMS has two options, and you want people to choose the option B. If you're a youngster, it's the option B. This option makes you the option B, to be better, who's going to pay USD 25
P 150 130.0 150 I'm going to give you some information, you may be interested, but MMS has two options and you want people to choose the option B. If you're a youngster, the option B makes you the best person who'll always pay 25 dollars in a printing house, if I can
P 152 130.0 152 I'll give you some information, but MMS has two options, and you want people to choose the option "MMS", which makes MMS better for those who are going to pay 25 dollars in a print run, if I can have two, at least.
P 154 130.0 154 I'll give you some information, but there are two options for ID, and you want people to choose which option to buy. This option makes you a better person, if you're going to pay less than US$ 25 or less for printing, if I can have two for it. Why can't I have two?
C 156 130.0 156 I don't have any spreadsheets, you might be interested, but there are two options for ID, and you want people to choose which option is best for you. This option makes sure that when you're a kid, you'll pay USD 25 or less than the price of the paper. I can have two options for the paper. (Laughter) This is the price of the paper, because I've been asked why all this?

P 424 416.0 424 One day, I had to talk to someone else, and it was interesting: it's a humor that's autistic, it's old, it's around the center, and it's white, it's 4%.
P 426 416.0 426 I've got to talk to someone else about a very interesting thing: it's a man who's autistic, he's old enough to be around the center, and he's white enough to be around the center. One day I'll ask him what he was going to do.
P 428 416.0 428 I'm talking about a wall that's in the middle of the street. It's a wall that's old, it's in the middle of the street, and it's old, it's 4 meters wide. You'll have to ask yourself how you've bought this wall and say, "Yes, 1,400 euros."

One day I asked myself what I'd bought it, and I said, "It's 1,400 Brazilian reais." (Laughter) But they don't need it.

P 750 728.0 750 So, out of these 35 thousand decisions, there's one that I've made, one that I don't know if you've ever heard of, one that I don't know if you've ever heard of, one that I don't know if you've ever heard of, one that I don't know if you've ever heard of, one that I don't know if you've ever heard of.
P 752 728.0 752 So, out of these 35,000 decisions, what you have to do is
C 754 728.0 754 So, from these 35 thousand decisions, I know that many decisions have to be made, and I know that more and more
P 756 754.0 756 I had to make these decisions in a digital world.
P 758 754.0 758 I've made one of these decisions in the digital world: there's an event

P 774 754.0 774 I've made one of these decisions in the digital world: there's an event that happened in 2016 that made the people of the world take 104 billion steps, what do you imagine was that? The launch of Pokémon Go. (Laughter) Because Pokémon Go is a game
P 776 754.0 776 I've made one of these decisions in the digital world: there's an event that happened in 2016 that made people in the world take 104 billion steps - what do you imagine was that? - The launch of Pokémon Go. (Laughter) Because Pokémon Go is a game that
P 778 754.0 778 I've made one of these decisions in the digital world: there's an event that happened in 2016 that made people in the world take 104 billion steps, what do you imagine was that? The launch of Pokémon Go. (Laughter) Because Pokémon Go is a game that brings a concept of augmented reality.
C 780 754.0 780 I've made one of these decisions in the digital world: there's an event that happened in 2016 that made people in the world take 104 billion steps, what do you imagine was that? (Laughter) Because the launch of Pokémon Go is a game that brings a sense of augmented reality, and we're getting more and more immersed in it.
P 782 780.0 782 I work in this world of augmented reality,
P 784 780.0 784 Look at this augmented reality world, virtual reality, machine learning,
P 786 780.0 786 I work in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know
P 788 780.0 788 I work in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly
P 790 780.0 790 I work in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
P 792 780.0 792 I look at this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, and I believe that if we

P 800 780.0 800 I look at this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, and I believe that if we understand better how these little circles work, how these neurons don't work, we will be able to
P 802 780.0 802 I look at this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, and I believe that if we understand better how these little circles work, how these neurons don't work, we will be able to build a better world.
P 804 780.0 804 I look at this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that I believe that if the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, and I understand better how these little circles work, how these nests work, we will be able to build a better world, we will be able to build better interfaces and
C 806 780.0 806 I look at this world of augmented reality, virtual learning, machine learning, and I believe that if the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, and I understand how these little circles work, how these nests work, we'll be able to build a better world, we'll be able to build better interfaces, and we'll be more aware.
P 808 806.0 808 So that we can make better decisions.
