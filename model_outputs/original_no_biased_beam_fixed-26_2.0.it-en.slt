P 198 182.0 198 So, what do we actually bring to the table? The discs, I'm part of this project, from the encounter with the cartridge, from the end of the file, from the waste, from what we often use, and here you have a small example.
P 200 182.0 200 So, what do we actually bring to the table? I started this project with the discard, from the encounter with the cartridge, from the end of the file, from the waste, from what we often use as a way of going. Here you have a small example of a discarded object.
P 202 182.0 202 So, what do we actually bring to the table? The discs. I've started this project from the encounter with the cartridge, from the end of the file, from the waste, from what we often use, right here, in front of you, you have a small example of discarding noble raw materials.
P 204 182.0 204 So, what do we really bring to the table? I started this project from the encounter with the cartridge, from the end of my daughter's house, from waste. Here you have a small example of scrapping noble raw materials. We're used to doing what I'm doing now.
P 206 182.0 206 So, what do we actually bring to the table? I started this project from the encounter with cartridges, from the end of my daughter's house, from waste. Here you have a small example of waste towards noble raw materials. We're used to doing what I'm doing now, every day, when we prune the vegetables.
C 208 182.0 208 So, what do we really bring to the table? I started this project from the encounter with cartridges, from the end of my daughter's house, from waste. Here you have a small example of waste towards noble raw materials. We're used to doing what I'm doing now, every day at home, when we prune the vegetables, and separating them.
P 210 208.0 210 On the one hand, there is the noble part.
P 212 208.0 212 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other, there's the waste.
P 214 208.0 214 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other, there's the waste.
P 216 208.0 216 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other, there's the waste, so the less noble part is the media.
P 218 208.0 218 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%.
P 220 208.0 220 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%; in winter, we reach even 70%.
P 222 208.0 222 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other hand, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%; in winter, we reach even 70% because so many vegetables grow.
P 224 208.0 224 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other hand, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%; in winter, we reach even 70% because so many vegetables have more protective parts.
P 226 208.0 226 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%; in winter, we reach even 70% because so many vegetables have more protective parts, so what does it mean to optimize?
P 228 208.0 228 On the one hand, there's the noble part that we use, and on the other hand, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%; in winter, we reach even 70% because so many vegetables have more protective parts, so what does optimizing in the kitchen mean?
P 230 208.0 230 On the one hand, there is the noble part, that we use, and on the other hand, there is the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, 50%; in winter, we reach even less than 70% because there are so many vegetables with more protective parts, so what does optimizing in the kitchen mean? It means changing the approach to food.
P 232 208.0 232 On the one hand, there's the noble part, that we use, and on the other hand, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%, in winter, because there are even more protective parts, so what does optimizing in the kitchen mean? It means changing the approach to food, it means using 100% of the materials.
C 234 208.0 234 On the one hand, there's the noble part, that we use, and on the other, there's the waste, so the less noble part is, on average, at least 50%; in winter, we get to even 70% because there are many more protective parts in the kitchen, so changing the approach to food means using 100% of the raw materials, but it doesn't mean being simple.
P 236 234.0 236 Basically, recovering these things.
P 238 234.0 238 Basically, recovering these things from waste.
P 240 234.0 240 Basically, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach.
P 242 234.0 242 Basically, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a whole.
P 244 234.0 244 Basically, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a whole, let's take an example.
P 246 234.0 246 Basically, recovering these things from the waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single thing together, let's take an example with "Mela."
P 248 234.0 248 Basically, recovering these things from the waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single thing together, let's take an example with "melon." I can see "melon" like this, OK?
P 250 234.0 250 Clearly, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single thing together, let's take an example with honey. I can see honey as a honey, but I can also see it.
P 252 234.0 252 Obviously, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single thing together, let's give an example with honey. I can see honey as a honey, but I can also see it as a set of four ingredients.
P 254 234.0 254 Clearly, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single whole, let's take an example with honey. I can see honey as a honey, but I can also see it as a set of four ingredients, for example, honey.
P 256 234.0 256 Clearly, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single thing together, let's take an example with honey, I can see honey as a honey, but I can also see it as a set of four ingredients, for example, pulp.
P 258 234.0 258 Clearly, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single thing together, let's take an example with honey, I can see honey with honey, but I can also see it as a set of four ingredients, for example, pulp, for simplicity, I've made chips, but I could have done it.
C 260 234.0 260 Clearly, recovering these things from waste means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a single whole, let's take an example with honey, I can also see honey as a group of four ingredients, for example, pulp, I simply made chips, but I could have liked it too, made a cake.
P 262 260.0 262 (Laughter)
P 264 260.0 264 (Laughter) Maybe I'm eating it like that.
P 266 260.0 266 I put the mouth on, maybe I'm eating it like that, or I dry it up and make a tea.
P 268 260.0 268 I put the mouth on, maybe I'm eating it like this, or I dry it, and I make a fantastic regenerative tea pot.
P 270 260.0 270 Now, maybe I'm eating the mouth like this, or I'm drying it, and I make a fantastic regenerative tea that if you buy from a butcher's shop, it will cost me more.
P 272 260.0 272 I'll leave the mouth, maybe I'll eat it like this, or I'll dry it and make a fantastic regenerative tea that you buy in the butchery, it will cost me more, the torso, the oil.
P 274 260.0 274 (Laughter) Maybe I'll leave it eating like this, or I'll dry it and make a fantastic regenerative tisana that you can buy in the butchery, it will cost me more, the torch, the centrifuge, and I'll let it ferment.
P 276 260.0 276 Now, the mouth, maybe I'll leave it eating like this, or I'll dry it and make a fantastic regenerative tisana that you buy in the butchery, it will cost me more, the worm, the centrifuge, and I'll let it ferment, so the juice is natural.
P 278 260.0 278 So, the mouth, maybe I'll leave it eating like this, or maybe I'll dry it and make a fantastic regenerative tea that if you buy butterflies, it will cost me more, the torso, the centrifuge, and I'll let it ferment to natural juice, it becomes an acetic, a beautiful piece of honey.
P 280 260.0 280 Now, the mouth, maybe I'll leave it eating like this, or maybe I'll dry it and make it a fantastic regenerative tisana that you can buy in the butchery, it will cost me more, the torsol, I'll let it ferment it, so the juice, in the natural, becomes an aceto, a beautiful aceto of honey, because it can also be made from the torsols.
P 282 260.0 282 Now, the mouth, maybe I'll leave it eating like this, or I'll dry it and make it a fantastic regenerative tisana that you can buy in the butcher's shop, it will cost me a lot of money and I'll let it ferment, so it becomes a natural juice, a great aceto, because aceto can also be made from twigs, and the seeds can be used as fertilizers.
P 284 260.0 284 Now, the mouth, maybe I'll leave it eating like this, or maybe I'll make it a fantastic regenerative tisana that you can buy in the butcher's shop, and I'll leave it to ferment, so naturally, it becomes an acetic, a great acetic of honey, because acetic can also be made from twigs, and the seeds can be used as a gelator, this is just an example with a product.
C 286 260.0 286 (Laughter) Maybe I'll leave it eating like this, or maybe I'll dry it and make it a fantastic regenerative tisana that you can eat with butterflies, and I'll leave it to ferment it with sugar, so naturally it becomes an acetic, a beautiful acetic of honey, because acetic can also be made from twigs, and the seeds, I can use them as gelatinizers, this is just an example with a product that should be familiar to you, but it's the concept.
P 288 286.0 288 It's a concept that we should apply to what we do.
P 290 286.0 290 This is a concept that we should apply to every single ingredient.
P 292 286.0 292 This is something that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, this one here, one of the vegetable shoots.
P 294 286.0 294 This is something that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardenings that I've had more time to love.
P 296 286.0 296 This is something that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardenings that I've had more time to love, to love 100 percent.
P 298 286.0 298 The point is that we should apply it to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardenings that I've had more time to love, to love 100% - I mean, for example, sugar.
P 300 286.0 300 This is something that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardens that I've had more time to love, to love 100% - I mean, for example, sugar, I like it a lot.
P 302 286.0 302 The point is that we should apply it to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardenings that I've had the most time to love, to love 100% - I mean, for example, sugar, I like it a lot because the mouth is the real part of it.
P 304 286.0 304 It's a point that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardenings that I've had the most time to love, to love 100% - I mean, for example, sugar, I like it a lot because the bubble is the real noble part, the one that concentrates on the largest quantity of food.
P 306 286.0 306 It's a fact that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardens that I've had the most time to love, to love 100% I mean, for example, sugar, I like it a lot because the bubble is the real noble part, the one where the largest amount of fiber is concentrated, it's less sweet than the pulp.
P 308 286.0 308 This is something that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardens that I've had the most time to love, to love 100% I mean, for example, sugar, I like it a lot because it's the real noble part, the one where the largest amount of fiber is concentrated, it's less sweet than pulp, for which, if you don't like it, it's sweet.
P 310 286.0 310 This is something that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardenings that I've had the most time to love - 100% love, I mean, the butterfly, for example, I like it a lot because it concentrates the largest amount of fiber, it's less sweet than the pulp, so maybe you don't like the sweet, too spicy, of the pulp.
C 312 286.0 312 This is something that we should apply to every single ingredient, another example, one of the vegetable gardenings that I've had the most time to love, I mean, to love the bud, for example, the one where the sugar concentrates the greatest amount of fiber, because I like it a lot, it's less sweet than the pulp, so if you don't like the sweet, too spicy, of the pulp, you can concentrate on the bud.
P 314 312.0 314 Also, the part that contains more fibers.
P 316 312.0 316 Also the part that contains more fibers, so a safe benefit.
P 318 312.0 318 There's also the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for health too, but not only that.
P 320 312.0 320 There's also the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for health too, but not only with all the internal filings.
P 322 312.0 322 It's also the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for health too, but not only that, with all the internal filings I can prepare a skirt, the breasts.
P 324 312.0 324 Also, the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for health too, but not only, with all the internal filings I can prepare a skirt, the seeds, I can prune them, or even prune them.
P 326 312.0 326 It's also the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for health too, but not only, with all the internal filings I can prepare a skirt, the seeds, I can touch them, or even simply shave them.
P 328 312.0 328 It's also the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for health too, but not only, with all the internal filings, I can prepare a sauce, the seeds, I can touch them, or even simply shave, shave something.
P 330 312.0 330 It's also the part that contains more fibers, so it's surely also a benefit for health, but not only, with all the internal filings, I can prepare a balm, the seeds, I can prune them, or even simply shave, shave something, I think it's a practical example.
P 332 312.0 332 It's also the part that contains more fibers, therefore a benefit for health, but not only with all the internal filings I can prepare a balm, the seeds I can prune, or also simply shave, shave something, I think it's a practical example of a very easy technique.
P 334 312.0 334 Also, the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for health too, but not only, with all the internal filings, I can prepare a cushion, the seeds, or even simply shave something, I think it's a practical example of a very easy technique, but it allows us to transform and value things.
P 336 312.0 336 Also, the part that contains more fibers, a benefit for our health, certainly, but not only, with all the internal filament, I can tame the seeds, or even simply tame a thing, I think it's a practical example of a very easy technique, but it also allows us to transform and value something that we already have.
C 338 312.0 338 It's also the part that contains more fibers, a safe benefit for health too, but not only, with all the internal filament, I can prepare a cushion, the seeds, or even simply put together something, I think it's a practical example of a very easy technique, but it also allows us to transform and value something that we all have at home and that is often missing.
P 340 338.0 340 We don't deserve a look and let's go.
P 342 338.0 342 We don't deserve a look and let's go, so optimize the kitchen for me.
P 344 338.0 344 We don't deserve a look and let's go. So, to optimize in the kitchen, for me, is above all this.
P 346 338.0 346 We don't deserve a look and let's do it. So, to optimize cooking for me, above all, to change my own mentality a little, and to see.
P 348 338.0 348 We don't deserve a look and let's go. So, to optimize in the kitchen, for me, above all this, to change our own mentality and to see with a different eye.
P 350 338.0 350 We don't deserve a look and let's go. So, to optimize in the kitchen, for me, above all this, to change our own mentality a little and to see with a different eye, in particular the vegetable gardeners.
P 352 338.0 352 We don't deserve a look and let's go. So, to optimize cooking for me, above all this, to change our own mentality a little, and to see with a different eye, in particular the vegetables, but all the food, in order to waste them less.
P 354 338.0 354 We don't deserve a look and let's go. So, to optimize cooking for me, above all, to change our own mentality a little and to see with a different eye, in particular the vegetables, but all the food, to waste it less and value it as much as possible.
P 356 338.0 356 We don't deserve a look and let's go. So, to optimize in the kitchen, especially for me, to change our own mentality a little and to see with a different eye, in particular the vegetables, but all the food, to waste it less and value it as much as possible. To optimize also means to optimize.
P 358 338.0 358 It's not a shame to have a look and let's go, so optimizing cooking for me, above all, changing my own mentality and seeing things with a different eye, in particular, vegetables, but all the food, to waste it less and value it as much as possible; optimizing also means optimizing water and energy consumption, for example.
P 360 338.0 360 We don't deserve a look and let's do it, so optimizing cooking for me, above all, changing my own mentality a little, and seeing things with a different eye, in particular, less waste and value food, but at the most, optimizing also means optimizing water and energy consumption, for example, every time I cook.
P 362 338.0 362 We don't deserve a look and let's do it. So, optimizing cooking for me, above all, changing my own mentality and seeing things with a different eye, in particular, eating less and making the most of food, also means optimizing the consumption of water and energy, for example, every time I cook or eat pasta, or vegetables.
C 364 338.0 364 It's not a shame to have a look and let's go. So, optimizing cooking for me, above all, changing my own mentality and seeing things with a different eye, in particular, eating less and eating more, also means optimizing the consumption of water and energy, for example, every time I cook or eat pasta or vegetables, I can, at the same time, cook other foods.
P 366 364.0 366 (Laughter)
P 368 364.0 368 It's just enough to have a star, it's not useful.
P 370 364.0 370 It's enough to have a star, it doesn't serve for anything, or maybe, every time.
P 372 364.0 372 It's enough to have a cap, it doesn't serve for anything, or maybe, every time I use a household appliance like a washing machine.
P 374 364.0 374 It's enough to have a hat, it doesn't serve for anything. Or, every time I use a household appliance like a washing machine, use it too.
P 376 364.0 376 It's enough to have a cap, it doesn't serve for anything. Or, every time I use a household appliance like a washing machine, I use it for sewing, and it's not just a feat.
P 378 364.0 378 It's not just a provocation, I'm sure some of you have.
P 380 364.0 380 It's enough to have a cap, it doesn't serve for anything. Or, every time I use a household appliance like a washing machine, use it for cooking, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure that someone is twisting their nose.
P 382 364.0 382 It's not just a provocation, I'm sure some of you're screwing your nose, but it's a technique of great cooking.
P 384 364.0 384 It's enough to have a scalpel, it doesn't serve for anything, or even, every time I use a washing machine, it's not just a provocation, I'm sure that someone is twisting their nose, but it's a cooking technique at a very high temperature.
P 386 364.0 386 It's enough to have a cap, it doesn't serve for anything. Or, every time I use a household appliance, like a washing machine - I'm sure some of you are twisting your nose - it's not just a cooking technique, at low temperature, so you don't have to buy a professional instrument.
P 388 364.0 388 It's enough to have a hat, it doesn't serve for anything. Or, every time I use it, I'm sure some of you use it just to brush your nose, and it's not just a domestic appliance, I'm sure some of you use it just to brush your nose, but it's a high cooking technique, it's at low temperature, so you don't have to buy a professional instrument for 2,000 euros.
C 390 364.0 390 It's enough to have a hat, it doesn't serve for anything, or maybe it's just a provocation, and I'm sure that every time I use a household appliance, I'm also wearing it to brush the nose, but it's a very high cooking technique, at low temperature, so you don't have to buy a professional instrument for 2,000 euros, but you can simply use a washing machine.
P 392 390.0 392 It's always when you wash the dishes.
P 394 390.0 394 Every time they wash the dishes, how do they do it?
P 396 390.0 396 Every time they wash the dishes, how do they do it? A very practical example: you take a bathtub.

P 418 416.0 418 It's Coca-Cola, Soda or Basso.
P 420 416.0 420 At Coca-Cola, soft or soft, depending on the washing machine you've chosen.
P 422 416.0 422 It's going to be the Koch-Sodo or Bisoto, depending on the washing machine you've chosen, and it's going to be fantastic.
P 424 416.0 424 It's going to be the coke, soda or soda, at the second of the wash that you've chosen, and it'll be fantastic because it's going to be at low temperature, so a lot.
P 426 416.0 426 It's going to be the Kook-Sodo or Bazoto washing machine that you've chosen, and it's going to be fantastic because it's going to be cooled at low temperature, so much better than the classic Sodo egg.

P 28 26.0 28 Physics in the lab.
P 30 26.0 30 I was working with physicists in the lab of Los Alamos, Ricardo Fierros and I.
P 32 26.0 32 The physicists at the lab of Los Alamos, Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes.
P 34 26.0 34 The physicists in the lab of Los Alamos, Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked.
P 36 26.0 36 The physicists in the room at the Lomas laboratory, Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?"
P 38 26.0 38 The physicists in the room at the Slammo lab, Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all of you?" He didn't talk about the other comments.
P 40 26.0 40 The physicists in the room at the Slammo lab, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?" He didn't talk about the other commensals, and he was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
P 42 26.0 42 The physicists in the room at the Slammo Laboratory, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all these people?" He didn't talk about the other commensals, and he was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was speechless, right?
P 44 26.0 44 The physicists in the room at the Slammo Laboratory, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?" He didn't talk about the other commensals, and he was thinking about the extraterrestrials, he was impatient, no, he had made a reasoning.
P 46 26.0 46 The physicists in the room in the lab of Los Alamos, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?" He didn't talk about the other comensals, and he was thinking about the extraterrestrials, he was impatient, no, he had made a reasoning. In our galaxy, there are two galaxies.
P 48 26.0 48 The physicists in the lab of Los Alamos, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all the comensals?" He wasn't talking about the other comensals, and he was thinking about the extraterrestrials. He was terrified, no, he was thinking, "In our galaxy, there are hundreds of billions of stars."
P 50 26.0 50 The physicists in the room at the Slammo Laboratory, Henrique, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?" He wasn't talking about the other comets, and he was thinking about the extraterrestrials, no, he was impatient, he had thought, "In our galaxy, there are hundreds of billions of stars, most of them older than us."
C 52 26.0 52 The physicists in the Mensa Laboratory of Los Alamos, Ricardo Fierros, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all the extraterrestrials?" He was thinking about the other comets, no, he was speechless, he had made a reasoning: "In our galaxy, there are hundreds of billions of stars, most of them are older than our Sun."
P 54 52.0 54 The oldest ones are 13 years old.
P 56 52.0 56 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun.

P 64 52.0 64 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old. So, if life were to disappear on some other planet,
P 66 52.0 66 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are four and a half billion years old. So, if life had disappeared on some other planet, around one of these stars?
P 68 52.0 68 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are four and a half billion years old. So, if life had disappeared on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, so much earlier.
P 70 52.0 70 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are four and a half billion years old. So, if life had disappeared on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which was on Earth a long time ago.
P 72 52.0 72 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and the Earth are four and a half billion years old. So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which could have existed on Earth long before, in the galaxy.
P 74 52.0 74 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are four and a half billion years old. Well, then, if life were to appear on another planet, around one of these stars, very old, very early on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, incredibly intelligent species.
P 76 52.0 76 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are four and a half billion years old. Well, then, if life were to appear on another planet, around one of these stars, very old, very early on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours.
C 78 52.0 78 The oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and the Earth are four and a half billion years old. Well, if life were to be found on another planet, around one of these stars, very old, so much earlier, that were on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced than ours.
