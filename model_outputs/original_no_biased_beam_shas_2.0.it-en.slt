P 521.572 511.571572 521.572 Now we've made this cartoon where Ana says, "Is it true that sometimes you use Massif Dawn as if it were an offensive?" (Laughter) "That's it, and you'd be 'up'?"
C 522.202 511.571572 522.202 Now, we've made this cardboard where Ana says, "But is it true that sometimes you use Massif Dawn as if it were an offensive?" (Laughter) "That's it, and you'll be 'up', so this is this."
P 525.263 523.263263 525.263 Or maybe another, where?
P 527.263 523.263263 527.263 Or there's another where it says, "Is it true that you say
P 529.263 523.263263 529.263 Or there's another where it says, "But is it true that you say 'affect by Down Syndrome' and not 'affect by Down Syndrome'?"

P 535.263 523.263263 535.263 Or another where it says, "But it's true that you say 'affection with Down syndrome' and you don't say 'affection with blue eyes.'" Well, this is said with Down syndrome, because believe it or not.
