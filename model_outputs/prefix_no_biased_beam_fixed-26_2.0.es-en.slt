P 128 104.0 128 And the forbidden has always been the most tempting. The one who makes diets and restricts fast food is constantly thinking about it: "Be, dream, smell, a fight with double jeopardy." So, going back to the theme, are we really able to
C 130 104.0 130 So, the forbidden has always been the most tempting, or not. The one who makes diets and restricts fast food is constantly thinking about pizzas: "Be, dream, smell, a double jeweler." So, going back to the subject, are we really able to say pizza, right?

P 154 130.0 154 (Laughter) The second aspect is practice. You learn how to eat, like every process in life, and in this case, and in many cases, I include myself, you learn again. We must learn how to eat at a station. What does this mean?
C 156 130.0 156 The second aspect is practice. You learn to eat, like every process in life, and in this case, and in many cases, I include myself, you learn again. We must learn to eat at the station, what this means, to eat the food that was harvested at that time.
P 158 156.0 158 So, what is going to happen

P 162 156.0 162 So, this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight and, therefore, a
P 164 156.0 164 So, this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight and, therefore, a enjoyment of our health.
P 166 156.0 166 So, this is going to guarantee control and balance of our weight, and also enjoy our health, because the harvested food
P 168 156.0 168 So, this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's also a joy for our health, because the harvested food, proper for its time,
P 170 156.0 170 So, this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's a joy for our health, because harvested food, typical of its time, is the most natural food.
P 172 156.0 172 So, this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's also a pleasure for our health, because the harvested food of its time is the most natural, the richest food.
P 174 156.0 174 This is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's a joy for our health, because the harvested food of its time is the most natural food, the richest in nutrients, and it's not
P 176 156.0 176 Well, this is going to guarantee us control and balance in our weight, and it's a pleasure for our health, because harvested food, typical of its time, is the most natural food, it's the richest in nutrients, and it's not chemically treated
P 178 156.0 178 Well, this is going to guarantee us control and balance in our weight, and it's a joy in our health, because harvested food, typical of its time, is the most natural food, it's the richest in nutrients, and it's not chemically treated to survive in time.
P 180 156.0 180 Well, this is going to guarantee us control and balance in our weight, and it's a joy in our health, because the harvested food of its time is the richest in nutrients, and it's not chemically treated to subsist in time, that is, it's not
C 182 156.0 182 Well, this is going to guarantee us control and balance in our weight, and it's a joy in our health, and not because the harvested food is richer in nutrients than it was at the time, it's the most chemically natural food to survive in time, that is, it's not addited with calories and
P 184 182.0 184 Or are they necessary for our body?
P 186 182.0 186 Is it necessary for our body or is it normal to see fruit all year round?
P 188 182.0 188 Or are they necessary for our body? Or is it normal to see fruits all year round? Or is it normal, Alberto Matteo?
P 190 182.0 190 It's either normal to see fruit all year round, or it's normal to see Alberto Matteo in winter and summer.
P 192 182.0 192 It's either necessary for our body, or it's normal to see fruits all year round, or it's normal Alberto Mattes in winter and summer.
P 194 182.0 194 It's either necessary for our body, or it's normal to see fruits all year round, or it's normal Alberto Mattes to see them in winter and summer.
P 196 182.0 196 It's true that we have a lot of fruits that are needed for our body, or it's normal to see them all year round, or it's normal to eat Alberto Mattes in winter and summer. So, this mechanism has come to practice and it's going to guarantee us some peppers.
P 198 182.0 198 So this mechanism, when put into practice, is going to guarantee us a high-quality food.
P 200 182.0 200 So this mechanism, when it comes into practice, will guarantee us a consumption of quality and of various ages.
P 202 182.0 202 It's a mechanism that allows us to reduce the amount of nutrients that are necessary for our body, or it's normal to see fruits all year round, or it's normal to see Alberto Matteo in winter and summer. So this mechanism, when it comes into practice, will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety, where we won't fall into monotony.
P 204 182.0 204 So this mechanism, when brought to practice, will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety, where we won't fall into the monotony of eating always the same.
P 206 182.0 206 It's either normal to see fruits all year round, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer. So this mechanism, when brought to practice, will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety, where we won't fall into the monotony of eating always the same.
C 208 182.0 208 It's either normal to eat fruits all year round, or it's normal to eat Alberto Matteo in winter and summer. So, this mechanism, when put into practice, will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety, where we won't fall into the monotony of eating always the same. The last aspect, which for me is
P 210 208.0 210 One is not a minor, but one of the
P 212 208.0 212 One of them, not the least but one of the most important, is moderation.
P 214 208.0 214 One of them, which is not minor but one of the most important, is moderation.
P 216 208.0 216 One of them, which is not minor but one of the most important, is moderation. Those who don't wake up because they don't
P 218 208.0 218 One of them, which is not a minor one, but one of the most important, is moderation. Those who don't wake up because they're not hungry, because they don't have time.
