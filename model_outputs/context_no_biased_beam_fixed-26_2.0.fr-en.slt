P 498 494.0 498 So I sent the rescue box to the
P 500 494.0 500 I used to send the rescue box. Well, we

P 542 520.0 542 Maybe this person is manipulating us. Fear of what they bring back to us, these ideas of death, what we all want to forget. So instead of listening to them, we tell them, "Don't think about that." Fear of not knowing what
P 544 520.0 544 Maybe this person is manipulating us. Fear of what they bring back to us, these ideas of death, what we would all want to forget. So instead of listening to them, we tell them, "Don't think about that." Fear of not knowing what to do, what to say,
C 546 520.0 546 Maybe this person is manipulating us. Fear of what they bring back to us, these ideas of death, what we all want to hear and forget. Instead of listening to them, we tell them, "Don't think about that." Fear of not knowing what to do, what to say, fear of having to solve these problems.
