P 334 312.0 334 you can change the world. And that's when I realized that, no matter how ecological I thought I was, in theory, I needed to put this into concrete actions. The only thing about having an idea is not having it.
P 336 312.0 336 you can change the world. And that's when I realized that no matter how ecological I thought I was, in theory, I needed to put this into concrete actions. The mere fact of having an idea is not enough. It's not enough to have an idea.
C 338 312.0 338 you can change the world. And that's when I realized that no matter how ecological I thought I was, in theory, I needed to put this into concrete actions. The mere fact of having an idea is not enough. So I started to think about it.

P 464 442.0 464 in the big problems in the world, she saw what an individual could do, slowly, but of course, every day, to change their little community. Now, what is exactly "how"? When the good idea is real, it's not just
P 466 442.0 466 in the big problems in the world, she saw what an individual could do, slowly but surely, every day, to change their little community. Now, what is exactly the best idea? When a good idea is really simple, and it's something very simple, it's something very simple.
C 468 442.0 468 in the big problems in the world, she saw what an individual could do, slowly but surely, every day, to change their little community. Now, what is exactly the best idea? When the good idea is really simple, and it's something that I realized throughout my journey, it's something that's very important.
P 470 468.0 470 (Laughter)
P 472 468.0 472 (Laughter) People don't have time.
P 474 468.0 474 People don't have time, they're simply not interested enough.
P 476 468.0 476 People don't have the time, they're just not interested enough in making fun of the environment.
P 478 468.0 478 People don't have the time, they're just not interested enough, to worry about the environment every day.

P 482 468.0 482 people don't have the time, they are simply not interested enough, to worry about the environment in every day life. So, it's time for us to take action.
P 484 468.0 484 people don't have time, they're just not interested enough to worry about the environment in every day life. So, we proposed to change our way of thinking.
P 486 468.0 486 people don't have time, they're just not interested enough to worry about the environment in every day life. So we proposed to change this question around the world.
P 488 468.0 488 people don't have time, they're just not interested enough to worry about the environment in every day life. So, we proposed to change this question around. If people were to take a look at the environment, we would have to change the way we see it.
P 490 468.0 490 people don't have time, they're just not interested enough to worry about the environment in every day life. So we proposed to change this question. If people don't want to be ecological or don't have the time to look at the environment in every day
P 492 468.0 492 people don't have time. It's simply not interesting enough to worry about the environment every day. So we proposed to change this question. If people don't want to be ecological, or don't have time, we should think about how to protect the environment.
C 494 468.0 494 people don't have time. They're just not interested enough in worrying about the environment every day. So, we proposed to change this question around. If people don't want to be ecological or don't have time, we should think about ecology for them.
P 496 494.0 496 (Laughter) Good.
P 498 494.0 498 (Laughter) So, we got the six million dollars.
P 500 494.0 500 (Laughter) So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and sold them.
P 502 494.0 502 So we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to a restaurant.
P 504 494.0 504 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and we went to one restaurant, to the other, and offered them to go to the restaurant, to the restaurant, to the restaurant, to the restaurant, to the restaurant.
P 506 494.0 506 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and offered these little trucks.
P 508 494.0 508 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little trucks as alternatives.
P 510 494.0 510 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little trucks as alternatives to single-use plastic trucks.
P 512 494.0 512 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little trucks as alternatives to single-use plastic trucks.
P 514 494.0 514 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little trucks as alternatives to single-use plastic trucks.
P 516 494.0 516 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and offered these little trucks as an alternative to single-use plastic trucks. So, our solution was to buy them.
P 518 494.0 518 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little trucks as alternatives to single-use plastic trucks. Now, our solution: instead of using a single-use plastic truck, we use a single-use plastic truck.
C 520 494.0 520 So, we took the 600,000 "storage trucks" and went to one restaurant, to the other, and proposed these little trucks as alternatives to single-use plastic trucks. Now, our solution: instead of using this plastic truck, you use the plastic truck.
P 522 520.0 522 I'm going to stress the sturdy steel.
P 524 520.0 524 (Applause)
P 526 520.0 526 It's a kind of "stressful steel stress." But I'm sure that's it.
P 528 520.0 528 I'm sure that plastic can only be used in a few years' time.
P 530 520.0 530 I'm sure that a single-use plastic can be found.
P 532 520.0 532 I'm sure that a single-use plastic can be found. It's very thinner than a single-use plastic.
P 534 520.0 534 I'm sure that the plastic that comes out of a single plastic can be very thinner than a single plastic.
P 536 520.0 536 I'm sure that the plastic single-use plastic is much brighter than just a single plastic 3D printer. But the plastic single-use plastic is much brighter than a single plastic 3D printer.
P 538 520.0 538 a single use plastic. But I'm sure that the emerging single use plastic is much brighter than just a single plastic. But the plastic "StreetStreet" and the "StreetStreet" are very similar.
P 540 520.0 540 I'm sure that the emerging single-use plastic is much brighter than just a single plastic box. But the plastic box and the single-use plastic box serve as a model.
P 542 520.0 542 I'm sure that the emerging single-use plastic is much brighter than just a single plastic box. But the plastic box and the sustainable plastic box serve as a symbol for everything that comes out of it.
P 544 520.0 544 I'm sure that the emerging single-use plastic is much brighter than just a single plastic box. But plastic box and sustainable plastic boxes serve as a symbol for everything that people can do in their daily lives.

C 832 806.0 832 Like the philosopher Guy Brin, the co-founder of Google, we will make machines that think and do things better than us. In this context, are we going to let people have average or modest cognitive abilities that are completely outdated compared to second-generation robots, born from the fusion of artificial intelligence and robotics?
