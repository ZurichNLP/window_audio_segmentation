P 493.94 489.94 493.94 I'm going to talk about, personally, how do you feel the fight?
C 494.16 489.94 494.16 I'm going to talk about, personally, how do you feel about the game?
C 496.7 495.41 496.7 I don't know.
C 503.83 502.52 503.83 There's also the subtitles where they come from.
P 521.56 519.56 521.56 Well, it looks like these.
P 523.56 519.56 523.56 Well, it looks like these two polarizing perspectives:
P 525.56 519.56 525.56 Well, it looks like these two polarizing perspectives: everything is big, the US
P 527.56 519.56 527.56 Well, it looks like these two polarizing perspectives: everything is big, the US has created all this freedom and freedom.
P 529.56 519.56 529.56 Well, it looks like these two polarizing perspectives: everything is big, the US has created all this freedom and freedom and everything that can be fantastic.
C 530.32 519.56 530.32 Well, it looks like these two polarizing perspectives: everything is big, the US has created all this freedom and freedom and everything that can be fantastic, or everything is terrible.
P 532.34 530.34 532.34 We've created all these tricks to hitch-hike and spit,
P 534.34 530.34 534.34 We've created all these tricks to hitch-hike and spit, and we don't control what we do.
C 534.58 530.34 534.58 We've created all these tricks to hitch-hike and spit, and we don't control what we say.
P 537.4 535.40 537.4 The ideas are all the same, right?
C 537.48 535.40 537.48 The ideas are all the same, right?
P 539.94 537.94 539.94 They've done everything, and they're both nice.
C 541.34 537.94 541.34 They've done everything, and they're both pretty happy and surprised.
P 543.67 541.67 543.67 And if you win in the long run,
C 544.5 541.67 544.5 And if you win in the long run, it's open to you.
P 546.75 544.75 546.75 It doesn't make sense if each one is doing better than the other,
P 548.75 544.75 548.75 It doesn't make sense if each one is doing better than the other, you know, they're both true.
C 548.76 544.75 548.76 It doesn't make sense if each one is doing better than the other, you know, they are both true.
P 551.29 549.29 551.29 And it's about us that we make the most of,
P 553.29 549.29 553.29 And it's about us that we make the most of, that we take advantage of.
P 555.29 549.29 555.29 And it's about us that we make the most of, that we take advantage of, because they're all there, and we all always want to be there.
P 557.29 549.29 557.29 And it's about us that we make the most of, that we take advantage of, because they're all there, and we all always want to be there.

P 563.93 561.93 563.93 There are two polarized perspectives.
P 565.93 561.93 565.93 There are two polarized perspectives of the Internet: the Internet is horrible,
P 567.93 561.93 567.93 There are two polarized perspectives of the Internet: the Internet is horrible, it's a platform.
C 569.73 561.93 569.73 There are two polarized perspectives of the Internet: the Internet is horrible, it's a platform for mass espionage.
P 571.97 569.97 571.97 It's used to spy,
P 573.97 569.97 573.97 It's used to spy, to control, to oppress.
C 574.37 569.97 574.37 It's used to spy, to control, to oppress.
P 576.49 574.49 576.49 On the other hand, there's another perspective:
P 578.49 574.49 578.49 On the other hand, there's another perspective: the fantastic Internet frees a place.
P 580.49 574.49 580.49 On the other hand, there's another perspective: the fantastic Internet frees a place of total freedom of expression.
C 581.09 574.49 581.09 On the other hand, there's another perspective: the fantastic Internet frees a place of total freedom of expression.
P 583.32 581.32 583.32 In reality, these things are equal,
P 585.32 581.32 585.32 In reality, these things are equal, they are true to each other.
P 587.32 581.32 587.32 In reality, these things are equal, they are true to each other, they coexist.
C 588.08 581.32 588.08 In reality, these things are equal, they are true to each other, they coexist in the same way.
P 590.88 588.88 590.88 Complex, to be something.
C 591.57 588.88 591.57 Complex, to be just one thing.
P 595.6 593.60 595.6 Aaron says one important thing:
P 597.6 593.60 597.6 Aaron says one important thing: "Saptuas depends on us what will win,
P 599.6 593.60 599.6 Aaron says one important thing: "Saptuas depends on us what will win, because the Internet will always be this."
C 600.61 593.60 600.61 Aaron says one important thing: "Saptuas depends on us what will win, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing."
P 603.42 601.42 603.42 I wanted to finish, not with words.
P 605.42 601.42 605.42 I wanted to finish, not with words of mine, because I don't have them,
C 607.28 601.42 607.28 I wanted to finish, not with words of mine, because I don't have them, but with words of someone braver.
P 610.24 608.24 610.24 The hell of living things isn't something that will be,
P 612.24 608.24 612.24 The hell of living things isn't something that will be, if there's one, it's what's already here,
P 614.24 608.24 614.24 The hell of living things isn't something that will be, if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day,
C 615.69 608.24 615.69 The hell of living things isn't something that will be, if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day, that we form together.
C 618.81 616.99 618.81 There are two ways to avoid suffering.
P 621.86 619.86 621.86 The first one is easy for many:
P 623.86 619.86 623.86 The first one is easy for many: to accept hell and become a part of it,
C 625.05 619.86 625.05 The first one is easy for many: to accept hell and become a part of it, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
P 627.84 625.84 627.84 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention.
P 629.84 625.84 629.84 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention and continuous learning:
P 631.84 625.84 631.84 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention and continuous learning: to seek and recognize.
P 633.84 625.84 633.84 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention and continuous learning: to seek and recognize who is what, in the middle.
P 635.84 625.84 635.84 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention and continuous learning: to seek and recognize who is what, in the middle of hell, is not hell,
P 637.84 625.84 637.84 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention and continuous learning: to seek and recognize who is what, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and to make it last and give it space.
C 639.11 625.84 639.11 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention and continuous learning: to seek and recognize who is what, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and to make it last and give it space. Thank you.

C 20.4 19.03 20.4 Good evening everyone.
P 22.85 20.85 22.85 In 1950, while I was studying,

P 26.85 20.85 26.85 In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the mind.
P 28.85 20.85 28.85 In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the Lisoa Mos lab,
P 30.85 20.85 30.85 In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the Lisoa Mos lab, Ricardo, sitting firm, suddenly raised his hand.

P 38.16 36.16 38.16 I didn't talk about the other commensals,
P 40.16 36.16 40.16 I didn't talk about the other commensals, I was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
C 40.25 36.16 40.25 I didn't talk about the other commensals, I was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
C 41.57 40.89 41.57 I was impatient.
C 43.55 41.59 43.55 No, he had made a reason.
P 46.59 44.59 46.59 In our galaxy there are hundreds.
C 48.29 44.59 48.29 In our galaxy there are hundreds of billions of stars.
P 50.31 48.31 50.31 Most of them are older.

P 61.93 59.93 61.93 So, if life were to appear?
P 63.93 59.93 63.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet,
P 65.93 59.93 65.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars,
P 67.93 59.93 67.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that is, very bright.
P 69.93 59.93 69.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before,
P 71.93 59.93 71.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before, they could exist in the galaxy.
P 73.93 59.93 73.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly.
P 75.93 59.93 75.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours.
P 77.93 59.93 77.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced.
P 79.93 59.93 79.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view,
C 81.91 59.93 81.91 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view, millions of years ahead of us.
P 83.93 81.93 83.93 Maybe they would be already traveling.
C 85.32 81.93 85.32 Maybe they would be already traveling among the stars.
P 87.93 85.93 87.93 However, we have never been contacted.
P 89.93 85.93 89.93 However, we have never been contacted by any of these hypotheses.
C 91.47 85.93 91.47 However, we have never been contacted by any of these hypothetical intelligent civilizations.
P 94.04 92.04 94.04 And here's the question: "Where are you from?"
C 95.29 92.04 95.29 And here's the question: "Where are all of them?"
P 98.55 96.55 98.55 It's something that...
P 100.55 96.55 100.55 It's something that can create some curiosity.
C 101.5 96.55 101.5 It's something that can create some curiosity, maybe even disconcert.
P 103.52 101.52 103.52 In fact, over the years,
P 105.52 101.52 105.52 In fact, over the years, many approaches have been tried.
C 107.28 101.52 107.28 In fact, over the years, many approaches have been tried to answer this question.
P 109.3 107.30 109.3 Many possible answers have been proposed.
P 111.3 107.30 111.3 Many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic,
P 113.3 107.30 113.3 Many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there,
P 115.3 107.30 115.3 Many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
C 115.67 107.30 115.67 Many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
C 118.02 116.61 118.02 So, this is possible.
P 120.96 118.96 120.96 I believe this is a question that we have all asked ourselves.
C 122.46 118.96 122.46 I believe this is a question that we have all asked ourselves, before and after.
C 124.6 122.69 124.6 At least I've always done it.
P 126.91 124.91 126.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a star.
P 128.91 124.91 128.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself,
P 130.91 124.91 130.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots
P 132.91 124.91 132.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets,
P 134.91 124.91 134.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings' planets,
P 136.91 124.91 136.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings' planets, which, at that moment, were there.

P 140.91 124.91 140.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings' planets, which, at that moment, were looking in my direction and were asking me the same question.
C 141.73 124.91 141.73 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings' planets, which, at that moment, were looking in my direction and were asking me the same question I was asking myself.
C 143.71 142.44 143.71 Now I do astrophysics.
P 146 144.00 146 I would like to find a scientific answer.
P 148 144.00 148 I would like to find a scientific answer to this question: "Are we alone?"
