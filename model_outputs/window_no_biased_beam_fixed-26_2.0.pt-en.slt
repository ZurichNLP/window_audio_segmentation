P 28 26.0 28 That's a good decision.
P 30 26.0 30 I'm going to make a decision. I'm going to give you a round of applause.
P 32 26.0 32 Let's talk about the decisions I want to tell you.
P 34 26.0 34 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed my life.
P 36 26.0 36 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed the way I thought about them.
P 38 26.0 38 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed the way I looked at them, and the way I took them. (Applause)
P 40 26.0 40 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed the way I thought about making decisions. It's an experiment that was done with this magazine.
P 42 26.0 42 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed the way I thought about making decisions. It's an experiment that was done with this magazine from now on. The Raciators of the World Cup, the World Cup of the World Cup of the World Cup of the World Cup of the World Cup of the World Cup of the World Cup.
P 44 26.0 44 to the audience. Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed the way I arrived at one of the decisions, changed the way I made decisions. It's an experiment that was done with this magazine a few years ago. The magazine's fans have three notions of this story.
P 46 26.0 46 to the audience. Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you something that changed my mind. One of the decisions changed my mind. It's an experiment that was done with this magazine a few years ago. The magazine's members have three notions of this nature: a digital structure, a social structure, and a political structure.
P 48 26.0 48 to the audience. Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my mind. One of the decisions changed my mind. It's an experiment that was done with this year's magazine. The magazine's fans have three notions of this nature: a digital platform with 50 or more users, and a digital platform with 50 or more users.
P 50 26.0 50 the audience. Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my mind. When I came to one of the decisions, it changed my mind to make decisions. It's an experiment that was done with this year's magazine. The magazine's members have three notions of this nature: a digital one, at 59 years old, and a print one.
C 52 26.0 52 to the audience. Speaking of decisions, what I want to tell you is a story that changed my mind. One of the decisions came to me, it changed my mind to take a decision. It's an experiment that was done with this year's magazine. The magazine's subscribers have three main notions: a digital structure, 50 years old; a printed magazine structure, 72 years old; and a social structure.
P 54 52.0 54 It's something that's more digital.
P 56 52.0 56 It's like digital plus print, and it's also a digital plus.
P 58 52.0 58 Nature is like digital plus print, and it's also like video games.
P 60 52.0 60 It's a digital plus-printing format, as well as seven small videos. The result of this exercise is that the vast majority of people think that digital plus-printing isn't a good thing.
P 62 52.0 62 It's a digital plus-printing format, as well as a seven-picture format. The result of this difference is that the vast majority of people chose the "go" you prefer.
P 64 52.0 64 that's how digital plus printing works, besides 75 dollars. The funny thing about this difference is that the vast majority of people chose a little for 75 dollars.
P 66 52.0 66 that's how digital plus printing works, besides being a source of income. The funny thing about this difference is that the vast majority of people chose a little for less than five dollars. I like these experiments a lot, but I don't like them.
P 68 52.0 68 that's a digital plus-printing format, plus seven chips. The funny thing about this difference is that the vast majority of people chose the stick for the seven plus five dollars. What I really like about these experiments is that there are usually two chips.
P 70 52.0 70 that is a digital plus-printing format, along with other seven plus-prints. The funny thing about this difference is that the vast majority of people chose the poop for the seven plus-five dollars. What I really like about these experiments is that there are usually two powders. For the second group, there are two powders, and for the third one, there are two powders.
P 72 52.0 72 I'm going to tell you a little bit about this experiment.
P 74 52.0 74 I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I'm going to tell you.
P 76 52.0 76 I'm going to tell you a little bit about this experiment, and I'm going to show you how it works.
C 78 52.0 78 I'm going to tell you a little bit about it, but I'm going to tell you a little about it.
P 80 78.0 80 I'm going to ask myself, what's interesting?
P 82 78.0 82 And what's interesting to me is that for this group of people, it's the most important thing.
P 84 78.0 84 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option.
P 86 78.0 86 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option.
P 88 78.0 88 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of the time, they chose the digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments that I've been doing, they say, "I'm going to write a book."
P 90 78.0 90 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments, I'm thinking, "It's just the idea of me, of certain people."
P 92 78.0 92 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of the time they chose the digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments I'm writing, it's just the idea of a few million people, of a print run.
P 94 78.0 94 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option. When they talk to me about these writing experiments, and it's just a matter of a few millimeters, a print run, that no one looks at.
P 96 78.0 96 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments with writing, and it's just the idea of a few thousand words, printed by lot, that no one chose, why is this the digital option?
P 98 78.0 98 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option. When they talk to me about the experiments I've been doing, and it's just a matter of money, of some printed money, that no one chose, why did this option change the lives of most of them?
P 100 78.0 100 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option. When they talk to me about the experiments I've been doing, and it's the idea of the "no" of several million people, printed, that no one chose, why did this option change? Most of them chose the digital option.
P 102 78.0 102 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option. When they talk to me about the experiences I've had, and it's the idea of the "no" of certain people, the printed choice, that no one chose, why did this choice change? And this made me very dissatisfied.
C 104 78.0 104 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose the digital option. When they talk to me about the experiences I've been through, and it's the idea of the "no" of certain individuals, the printed choice, that no one chose. Why did this choice change? The majority of people chose it at one point. And this left me very uncomfortable. What's going to happen next?
P 106 104.0 106 Would you like to make this decision?
P 108 104.0 108 If I had made this decision, I would have started to study about it.
P 110 104.0 110 When I made this decision, I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I studied this second half of my life.
P 112 104.0 112 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and this is my last name. It's called TEDxRíodelaPlata.
P 114 104.0 114 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I found out that this last month has a name, it's called TEDxCOI. It's the name that's put on it. It's called TEDxCOI.
P 116 104.0 116 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied about it, and I found out that this word has a half name, it's called "coyo," it's the person who's put in an equation to influence people.
P 118 104.0 118 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I found out that this second medium has a surname, it's called "coyo," or being put in an equation to influence a person's decision.
P 120 104.0 120 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this second month has a nickname, it's called "coyo," or being put in an equation to influence a person's decision. And I learned that, in order to make a decision, we need to have a relationship.
P 122 104.0 122 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this second month, in her last name, she's called Coli, or she's being put in an equation to influence, with the gender, one decision or another. I learned a lot about this from a theory called the "college model."
P 124 104.0 124 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I studied that this second month and gave it its name. It's called "coyo" or "to be put in an equation" to influence, with the stereotype, one decision or another. I learned a lot about this, not the so-called "economic" theory, but the "traditional" one.
P 126 104.0 126 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, I studied this second semester, and my name is Tiki Kohi. It's about being involved in an equation to influence one decision or another. I learned a lot about this, not so much about the so-called "ethical" theory, but about the theory that studies cognitive biology.
P 128 104.0 128 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, I studied this second semester, and it got my name. It's about being involved in an equation to influence one decision or another. I learned a lot about this not called the "traditional" economy, but the one that studies cognitive biology and neuroscience applied to these subjects.
C 130 104.0 130 to make this decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, I studied this second tool and its name. It's called Ticket. It's about being involved in an equation to influence one decision or another. I learned a lot about this from a theory called Economics or Traditional, the theory that studies cognitive psychology and neuroscience applied to decision-making. The analogy between science and decision-making.
P 132 130.0 132 (Laughter) (Applause)
P 134 130.0 134 It's interesting, I'm going to ask you to use it.
P 136 130.0 136 It's interesting to see that you can use it, but you have two options.
P 138 130.0 138 It's interesting, you can see it, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose what they want.
P 140 130.0 140 It's interesting, you can see it there, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the one you like.
P 142 130.0 142 It's interesting, you can see it, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the one you like the most. You play or you're less good at the option.
P 144 130.0 144 It's interesting, you've seen it, but you have two options on YouTube, and you want people to choose the one you like the most. Do you play or are you less good at the option?
P 146 130.0 146 It's interesting, you've seen it, but you have two options on YouTube, and you want people to choose the one you like the most, you play the one you like the least, and this option makes you the best person for those who want to play it.
P 148 130.0 148 It's interesting, you can see it there, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the one you like the most. You play the one you like the most. This option makes the iPhone the best for those who will always pay USD 25 in the next year.
P 150 130.0 150 It's interesting, you can see it there, but you have two options on YouTube, and you want people to choose the option T. Do you play it or are you less good at it? This option D makes the sound better for those who are going to pay more than US$ 200 on the press, if I can have an option A, or if I can have an option B, if I can have an option C.
P 152 130.0 152 It's interesting, you can see it there, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the one you like the most. Do you play the one you like the most? This option makes the iPad better for those who will spend $25 in the next print, if I can have two for the first one. (Applause)
P 154 130.0 154 It's interesting, you've got two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the one you like the most. Do you play the one you like the most? Do you play the one you like the most? That's the option. If you play the one you like the most, you'll get better. If you play the one you like the most, you'll get better. If you play the one you like, you'll get better.
C 156 130.0 156 It's interesting, you're watching it, but I think you have two options, and you want people to choose the option "to be good" or "to be bad" in the run. This option "to be good" makes you play less bad, so that for those who play "to be good" for US$ 25 in the run, you can have two for the run. It's amazing, because I'm passionate about management, why is all this?
P 158 156.0 158 And one talk included two.
P 160 156.0 160 And one talk, including a TEDx talk, made it all online.
P 162 156.0 162 And in a talk, including a TED talk, he made me go to the Internet. When he gave a talk, he made me go to the Internet.
P 164 156.0 164 And in a talk, including a TEDx talk, he made a comparison between these two databases.
P 166 156.0 166 And in a talk, including a TEDx talk that made me interested, he made a comparison between these combinations and the most utopian illusion.
P 168 156.0 168 And in a talk, including a TED talk, I got interested in it all. In a talk, he made a comparison between these two combinations with the most orthopedic ones. I think everyone here in the world is aware of this.
P 170 156.0 170 and a talk, including a TED talk, made me interested. With another talk, he made a comparison between these combinations and the NGOs. I think everyone here in the world is familiar with the NGOs in Rio de Janeiro. The cycle of the NGOs, the NGOs in Rio de Janeiro, the NGOs in Rio de Janeiro, the NGOs in Rio de Janeiro, and the NGOs in Rio de Janeiro.
P 172 156.0 172 and a talk by Terry Walsh, which made me interested, when he made a comparison of these combinations with Nortec, I think everyone here in the world is familiar with it. The blue circle on the left looks a little bit like the red circle on the right, and the blue circle on the left looks a little like the red circle on the right.
P 174 156.0 174 and a talk by Terry Walsh, which made it all interesting, when he made a comparison of these shapes with the North American ones. I think everyone shared the same idea. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right.
P 176 156.0 176 a talk, including Terry Walsh, and made it all interesting. When he made a comparison of these shapes with the North American ones, I think everyone shared the same idea. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. Now, what about the blue circle on the right?
P 178 156.0 178 a talk, including Terry Walsh, and made it all interesting. When I wrote my paper, he made a comparison of these shapes with the North American ones. I think everyone shares the same idea. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. OK? Because I've come back to this question.
P 180 156.0 180 a talk, including Terry Walsh, and made a lot of interest. When one of them made a comparison of these shapes with the North American ones, I think everyone shares the same idea. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. OK? Because I've got around, let's make it look different.
C 182 156.0 182 and a talk by Terry Walsh, who made a lot of interest, when he made a comparison of these shapes with the North American ones. I think everyone shares the same idea. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. So, what I have around me is to make people look different. Actually, they're in the right.
P 184 182.0 184 Well, but we check it.
P 186 182.0 186 But let's check if there's a CFR around the two fluids.
P 188 182.0 188 But we see it as a kind of stereotype that surrounds us and influences us.
P 190 182.0 190 But let's take a look at the stereotype that influencers have around us. To have another kind of ideology that doesn't make a difference.
P 192 182.0 192 But let's see if there's any other way I can influence them. There's another ideological illusion that's going to make me happy when I see it, and it's this one.
P 194 182.0 194 But let's check if there's any kind of influence around us. There's another kind of influence that's going to make me happy when I see it, and it's this one. The pieces of "statuette" from above.
P 196 182.0 196 But let's check if there's a different way of looking at the influencers. There's another ideological lesson that I'll share with you when I see it, which is this one. The pieces from the top are the same as the pieces from the bottom.
P 198 182.0 198 But let's check if there's some sort of stereotype about influencers. There's another stereotype that will make me laugh when I see it, and it's this one. The chess pieces from above are the same as the chess pieces from below. (Applause)
P 200 182.0 200 But let's check if there's some sort of stereotype around the influencers. There's another stereotype that made me laugh when I saw it, and it's this one. The pieces of t-shirt on the top are the same as the pieces of t-shirt on the bottom. It's at this point in time that I'm talking to you.
P 202 182.0 202 But let's check if there's a different way around the influencers. There's another ideological lesson that made me laugh when I saw it, which is this one. The pieces of t-shirt from above are the same as the pieces of t-shirt from below. It's at this point that the equator says, "Hey, I've got a problem with the flip-flops."
P 204 182.0 204 But let's check if there's any other way around the influencers. There's another ideological lesson that made me laugh when I saw it, and it's this: the pieces from the top are the same as the pieces from the bottom. It's at this point that the guy says, "Hey, there's a problem with the shape of this, but I'll show you why."

C 208 182.0 208 But let's check if there's a borderline around the influencers.

P 232 208.0 232 the pieces, just looking at the background, we see that they are really cool.

C 234 208.0 234 in the pieces, just looking at the background, we see that they are really cool. When I saw this question, I really understood, and it makes sense to say that it has something to do with us. As much as it has something to do with the way people see things, it has something to do with the right to make any kind of decision. The work in technology.
