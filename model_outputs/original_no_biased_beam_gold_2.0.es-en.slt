P 33.07 31.07 33.07 I think it's necessary.

P 67.82 63.82 67.82 Each sound had a letter to correspond to.

P 90.21 88.21 90.21 It's there because of the Spanish language.
P 92.21 88.21 92.21 It's there because Spanish differs from other languages, like English.

P 149.14 143.14 149.14 That's how we ended up with six, seven, three letters that in some places match.
P 151.14 143.14 151.14 That's how we get to "se" and "se" and "seta," three letters that in some places correspond to one sound and in others to another.
P 153.14 143.14 153.14 That's how we get to "se" and "se" and "seta," three letters that in some places correspond to one sound and in others to two, but in none of them to three.
