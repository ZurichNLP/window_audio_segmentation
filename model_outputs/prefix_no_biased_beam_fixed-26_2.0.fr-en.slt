P 464 442.0 464 (Laughter) It's a question of despair, the loss of hope too. How many times do we hear that the loss of hope is also a choice? But how can we choose when we are lost in pain?
P 466 442.0 466 (Laughter) It's a question of choice too. How many times can we also hear the loss of hope when we are lost in pain? How many times can we hear the loss of hope when we are lost in pain?

P 470 468.0 470 (Laughter) It's just a
P 472 468.0 472 (Laughter) It's just a call for help.
P 474 468.0 474 (Laughter) It's just a call for help. So, of course, it
P 476 468.0 476 (Laughter) It's just a call for help. Of course, it reassures us, but what
P 478 468.0 478 (Laughter) It's just a call for help. Of course, it reassures us, but sometimes it trivializes.

P 496 494.0 496 So I sent the rescue box.
P 498 494.0 498 The day I sent the rescue box,
P 500 494.0 500 The day I sent the rescue box, well, we had
P 502 494.0 502 When I was about to send the rescue box, well, we are afraid,
P 504 494.0 504 The day I sent the rescue box, well, we are afraid, afraid of this suffering, that we can't
P 506 494.0 506 The day I sent the rescue box, well, we are afraid, afraid of this suffering that we can't measure.
P 508 494.0 508 The day I sent the rescue box, we were afraid, afraid of this suffering that we couldn't measure because it didn't heal.
P 510 494.0 510 The day I sent the rescue box, we were afraid of this suffering that we couldn't measure because it didn't heal, and we couldn't
P 512 494.0 512 The day I sent the rescue box, afraid of this suffering that we can't measure because it doesn't heal, and we can't take a nap to know
P 514 494.0 514 The day I sent the rescue box, we were afraid of this suffering that we couldn't measure because it didn't heal, and we couldn't take a blood sample to know how much this suffering
P 516 494.0 516 The day I sent the rescue box, we were afraid of this suffering that we couldn't measure because it didn't heal, and we couldn't take a blood sample to know how much this person was suffering.
P 518 494.0 518 The day I sent the rescue box, we were afraid of this suffering that we couldn't measure because it didn't heal, and we couldn't take a blood sample to know how much this person was suffering.
C 520 494.0 520 The day I sent the rescue box, we were afraid of this suffering, because we couldn't measure it, and we couldn't take a blood sample to know how much this person was suffering. So we doubted, and we thought,
P 522 520.0 522 Maybe this person is manipulating
P 524 520.0 524 Or maybe this person, whom I manipulate,
P 526 520.0 526 Or maybe this person, whom I manipulate, is afraid
P 528 520.0 528 Or maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what he or she
P 530 520.0 530 Or maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what they send us, these ideas of death.
P 532 520.0 532 And maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what they send us back, these ideas of death, what we would like
P 534 520.0 534 And maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what they send us, these ideas of death, what we would all want to forget.
P 536 520.0 536 And maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what they send us, these ideas of death, what we all want to forget. So instead of listening to them and telling them,
P 538 520.0 538 And maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what they send us, these ideas of death, what we all want to forget, so instead of listening to them and listening to them, we tell them, "We don't have to think about that."
P 540 520.0 540 And maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what they are sending us, these ideas of death, what we would all want to forget, so instead of listening to them and telling them, "Don't think about that,
P 542 520.0 542 And maybe this person is manipulating us, afraid of what they send us, these ideas of death, what we all want to forget. So instead of listening to them and listening to them, we tell them, "We don't have to think about that." Fear of not knowing what
P 544 520.0 544 And maybe this person manipulates us, fear of what they send us, these ideas of death, what we would all want to forget. So instead of listening to them and listening to them, we tell them, "We shouldn't think about that." Fear of not knowing what to do, what to say,
C 546 520.0 546 And maybe this person manipulates us: fear of what they send us, these ideas of death, what we would all want to forget. So instead of listening to them, we tell them, "We shouldn't think about that," fear of not knowing what to do, what to say, fear of having these problems solved.
P 548 546.0 548 So let's take a look at
P 550 546.0 550 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us.
P 552 546.0 552 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a matter of
P 554 546.0 554 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business,
P 556 546.0 556 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And for
P 558 546.0 558 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And yet, these people
P 560 546.0 560 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And yet, these people are on our side.
P 562 546.0 562 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And yet, these people, they are on our side, and they
P 564 546.0 564 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And yet, these people are counting on us. So, how
P 566 546.0 566 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And yet, these people are counting on us. So, how do we
P 568 546.0 568 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And yet, these people are counting on us. So, how can we get out of this impasse?
P 570 546.0 570 So we say to ourselves, "This doesn't look at us, it's a specialist's business." And yet, these people are counting on us. So, how can we get out of this impasse? How can we extend our hand to them?
C 572 546.0 572 So we say to ourselves, "This isn't a specialist's thing, it's not a specialist's thing." And yet, these people are counting on us. So, how can we get out of this impasse? How can we extend our hand to them and make them take it?
P 574 572.0 574 The desire, the
P 576 572.0 576 To dream, well,
P 578 572.0 578 And I have to say, "Well, the only one, the only one
P 580 572.0 580 I'm going to say, "Well, the only, the only way out, it's in

P 592 572.0 592 What I want to say is that the only thing is to talk about it, and to do that, we need to take this step aside, to get rid of everything that makes us
P 594 572.0 594 What I want to say is that the only thing there is, it's to talk about it, and for that, we need to take this step aside, to get rid of everything that hinders meeting it.
P 596 572.0 596 It's the only thing there. And for that, we need to take this step, to step aside, to get rid of everything that hinders meeting her, of everything that will make her false.
C 598 572.0 598 It's the only thing here. And to do that, we need to step aside, to get rid of all the obstacles to meeting it, of all the things that will distort our judgment, and also
