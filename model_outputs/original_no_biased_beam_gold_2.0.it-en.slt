P 515.98 501.98 515.98 For example, a bit of time ago, Francesca came home saying, "You know, they use it as an offensive at school." So we made this cardboard where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use it."
C 517.96 501.98 517.96 For example, a bit of time ago, Francesca came home saying, "You know, they use sex as an offensive at school." So we made this cartoon where Anna says, "Is it true that sometimes you use sex as an offensive?"

P 534.35 532.35 534.35 It's called Down Syndrome.

P 627.84 625.84 627.84 Second risk: it requires attention.
P 629.84 625.84 629.84 Secondly, it requires attention and continuous learning.
P 631.84 625.84 631.84 Secondly, it requires attention and continuous learning: looking for and knowing.
P 633.84 625.84 633.84 Secondly, it requires attention and continuous learning: to look for and know how to recognize who is what in the middle.
P 635.84 625.84 635.84 Secondly, it requires attention and continuous learning: looking for and knowing who it is, in the middle of hell, is not hell.
P 637.84 625.84 637.84 Secondly, it is risky and requires attention and continuous learning: to seek and recognize who is what, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and to make it last and give it space.

C 20.4 19.03 20.4 Good evening everyone.
P 22.85 20.85 22.85 In 1950.
P 24.85 20.85 24.85 In 1950, while I was eating with algae,
P 26.85 20.85 26.85 In 1950, while eating with some physical colleagues in my mind,
P 28.85 20.85 28.85 In 1950, while I was eating with some of my physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the L.A.M.S.
P 30.85 20.85 30.85 In 1950, while eating with some of my physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the Salsamo lab, Ricardo kept his hands tight.
P 32.85 20.85 32.85 In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the L'Halamo lab, Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate.
P 34.85 20.85 34.85 In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the Lisoa Mos lab, Ricardo, standing firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are you all?"
C 35.54 20.85 35.54 In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the soup kitchen of the Lisoa Mos lab, Ricardo, sitting firm, suddenly raised his eyes from the plate and asked, "Where are all of them?"
P 38.16 36.16 38.16 I didn't talk about the other commensals.
P 40.16 36.16 40.16 I didn't talk about the other commensals, I was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
C 40.25 36.16 40.25 I didn't talk about the other commensals, I was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
C 41.57 40.89 41.57 I was impatient.
C 43.55 41.59 43.55 No, he had made a reason.
P 46.59 44.59 46.59 In our galaxy, there are hundreds of stars.
C 48.29 44.59 48.29 In our galaxy there are hundreds of billions of stars.
P 50.31 48.31 50.31 Most of them are older.
P 52.31 48.31 52.31 Most of them are older than our sun.
P 54.31 48.31 54.31 Most of them are older than our sun, the oldest ones are 13 billion years old.
P 56.31 48.31 56.31 Most of them are older than our Sun, the oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth.
P 58.31 48.31 58.31 Most of them are older than our Sun, the oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old.
C 59.08 48.31 59.08 Most of them are older than our Sun, the oldest ones are 13 billion years old, our Sun and Earth are 4.5 billion years old.
P 61.93 59.93 61.93 So, what if life was a part of us?
P 63.93 59.93 63.93 So, what if life was scattered on some other planet?
P 65.93 59.93 65.93 So, what if life were to disappear on another planet, around one of these stars?
P 67.93 59.93 67.93 So, if life were to disappear on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which is very young.
P 69.93 59.93 69.93 So, if life were to disappear on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which was on Earth a long time ago.
P 71.93 59.93 71.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these very ancient stars, which, therefore, existed on Earth long before, it could exist in the galaxy.
P 73.93 59.93 73.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these very ancient stars, which were on Earth long before, there could be, in the galaxy, incredible, intelligent species.
P 75.93 59.93 75.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which were on Earth long before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours.
P 77.93 59.93 77.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which were on Earth long before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly advanced by the way.
P 79.93 59.93 79.93 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, which were on Earth long before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view.
C 81.91 59.93 81.91 So, if life were to appear on some other planet, around one of these stars, very, very old, that were on Earth before, they could exist in the galaxy as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view, millions of years ahead of us.
P 83.93 81.93 83.93 Maybe they'd already be traveling.
C 85.32 81.93 85.32 Maybe they would be already traveling among the stars.
P 87.93 85.93 87.93 But we have never been like that.
P 89.93 85.93 89.93 However, we have never been contacted by any of these hypotheses.
C 91.47 85.93 91.47 However, we have never been contacted by any of these hypothetical intelligent civilizations.
P 94.04 92.04 94.04 Here's the question: "Where are you from?"
C 95.29 92.04 95.29 And here's the question: "Where are all of them?"
P 98.55 96.55 98.55 It's something that, after all,
P 100.55 96.55 100.55 It's something that can create some curiosity.
C 101.5 96.55 101.5 It's something that can create some curiosity, maybe even disconcert.
P 103.52 101.52 103.52 And in effect, in the course of time.
P 105.52 101.52 105.52 In fact, over the years, many approaches have been tried.
C 107.28 101.52 107.28 In fact, over the years, many approaches have been tried to answer this question.
P 109.3 107.30 109.3 Many possible ideas have been put forward.
P 111.3 107.30 111.3 Many possible answers have been offered, some very fantastic.
P 113.3 107.30 113.3 There have been proposals, many possible answers, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no such thing.
P 115.3 107.30 115.3 There have been proposals, many possible answers, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
C 115.67 107.30 115.67 Many possible answers have been proposed, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
C 118.02 116.61 118.02 So, this is possible.
P 120.96 118.96 120.96 I believe this is a question we have all asked ourselves.
C 122.46 118.96 122.46 I believe this is a question that we have all asked ourselves, before and after.
C 124.6 122.69 124.6 At least I've always done it.
P 126.91 124.91 126.91 When I was a child, I watched a TV show.
P 128.91 124.91 128.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself,
P 130.91 124.91 130.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if around those dots
P 132.91 124.91 132.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those bright spots could be planets.
P 134.91 124.91 134.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings on those planets.

P 138.91 124.91 138.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings' planets, which, at that moment, were looking in my direction.
P 140.91 124.91 140.91 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings' planets, which, at that moment, were looking in my direction and asking me the same question.
C 141.73 124.91 141.73 When I was a kid, I looked at a starry sky and asked myself if those luminous dots could be planets, or living beings' planets, which, at that moment, were looking in my direction and were asking me the same question I was asking myself.
C 143.71 142.44 143.71 Now I do astrophysics.
P 146 144.00 146 I would like to find a scientific answer.
P 148 144.00 148 I would like to find a scientific answer to this question: "Are we alone?"
C 148.83 144.00 148.83 I would like to find a scientific answer to this question: "Are we alone in the universe?"
P 151.19 149.19 151.19 And I really believe that I found it.

P 161.19 149.19 161.19 I truly believe that finding evidence that there is life outside the Earth would be an epic change for our species, for understanding.
P 163.19 149.19 163.19 And I truly believe that finding evidence that there is life outside the Earth would be an epic change for our species, for the understanding of the place that it occupies.
C 164.47 149.19 164.47 I truly believe that finding evidence that there is life outside the Earth would be an epic change for our species, for the understanding of the place we occupy in the universe.

P 194.57 186.57 194.57 And finding the scientific evidence of the existence of other inhabited worlds, I think would be a third big revolution.
P 196.57 186.57 196.57 And to find the scientific evidence of the existence of other inhabited worlds, I think it would be a third great revolution, comparable and perhaps right on.
P 198.57 186.57 198.57 And finding the scientific evidence of the existence of other inhabited worlds, I think it would be a third great revolution, comparable and perhaps even higher than the other two.

P 205.16 201.16 205.16 Well, in recent years, we've probably done many strolls.
