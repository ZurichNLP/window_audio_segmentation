P 79.39 80.39 So some intuition
P 79.39 81.39 So some intuition that you may

C 340.92 342.439999 So let's think about the atoms.
P 342.59 343.59 So in one
P 342.59 344.59 So in one case: all the
P 342.59 345.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms
P 342.59 346.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up
P 342.59 347.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of
P 342.59 348.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting
P 342.59 349.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at
P 342.59 350.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time
P 342.59 351.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms
P 342.59 352.59 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up
C 342.59 352.86999999999995 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
P 353.639999 354.639999 Now it's only
P 353.639999 355.639999 Now it's only at precise times
C 353.639999 355.699999 Now it's only at precise times when they align.
P 356.009999 357.009999 The rest of the
C 356.009999 357.65 The rest of the time they're delocalized.
P 358.52 359.52 That means that
P 358.52 360.52 That means that every atom is
P 358.52 361.52 That means that every atom is in two different
P 358.52 362.52 That means that every atom is in two different places at the
P 358.52 363.52 That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which
P 358.52 364.52 That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means
P 358.52 365.52 That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk
P 358.52 366.52 That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is
C 358.52 367.24 That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places.
P 367.42 368.42 I think
P 367.42 369.42 I think this is
P 367.42 370.42 I think this is really cool.
P 367.42 371.42 I think this is really cool. (Laughter) Really.
C 367.42 372.0 I think this is really cool. (Laughter) Really.

P 376.109999 377.109999 It was worth

P 376.109999 385.109999 It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single

P 376.109999 388.109999 It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the
P 376.109999 389.109999 It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the

P 390.83 391.83 So if a single
P 390.83 392.83 So if a single atom can be in
P 390.83 393.83 So if a single atom can be in two different places at
P 390.83 394.83 So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that
P 390.83 395.83 So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that chunk of metal can
P 390.83 396.83 So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that chunk of metal can be in two different

P 398.55 399.55 I mean,
P 398.55 400.55 I mean, this is
P 398.55 401.55 I mean, this is just my
C 398.55 401.81 I mean, this is just my logical side talking.
P 403.22 404.22 So imagine if

C 403.22 408.76000000000005 So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time, what would that be like?
P 410.23 411.23 How would
P 410.23 412.23 How would your consciousness
P 410.23 413.23 How would your consciousness handle your

P 417.13 418.13 There's one more part
C 417.13 418.38 There's one more part to the story.
P 418.38 419.38 It's when we warmed
P 418.38 420.38 It's when we warmed it up, and we
P 418.38 421.38 It's when we warmed it up, and we turned on the lights

P 427.24 428.24 And so I
P 427.24 429.24 And so I had to develop
P 427.24 430.24 And so I had to develop this new intuition,

P 447.71 448.71 It's that

P 109.1 110.1 Now why
P 109.1 111.1 Now why do we
P 109.1 112.1 Now why do we draw technology

P 113.29 114.29 Well the answer
P 113.29 115.29 Well the answer is, if I
P 113.29 116.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on
P 113.29 117.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve
P 113.29 118.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say,
P 113.29 119.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years,
P 113.29 120.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time

P 113.29 125.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to
P 113.29 126.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph, the graphs
P 113.29 127.29 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph, the graphs look sort of
P 113.29 128.29000000000002 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph, the graphs look sort of silly.
C 113.29 128.6 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph, the graphs look sort of silly.
P 129.34 130.34 They sort of
C 129.34 130.55 They sort of go like this.

C 133.13 134.34 And they don't tell us much.
P 135.599999 136.599999 Now if I
P 135.599999 137.599999 Now if I graph, for instance,
P 135.599999 138.599999 Now if I graph, for instance, some other technology,
