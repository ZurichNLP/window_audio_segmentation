P 158 156.0 158 Let's do it.
P 160 156.0 160 It's three times more than children decide.
P 162 156.0 162 It's three times more than the audience of the public voice we're talking about.
P 164 156.0 164 It's three times more than the audience of "La Voix Publique", who talk to us very often on TV every time we leave on holiday.
P 166 156.0 166 Decide. It's three times more than the audience of "La Voix Publique", whom we hear very often on TV every time we leave on vacation.
P 168 156.0 168 Decide. It's three times more than the audience of "La voix publique," who we hear very often on TV every time we leave on holiday. And what about these tragedies?
P 170 156.0 170 Decide. It's three times more than the audience of the public channel, who we hear very often on TV when we leave on holiday, and not much about these dramas.
P 172 156.0 172 It's three times more than the audience of the public channel. We're very often told about them on TV when we start off on vacation, and not much about these dramas.

P 178 156.0 178 So, we decide. It's three times more than the audience on the public highway, which we hear about on TV, not every time we go on holiday, and it's about these tragedies, not to mention the 160,000 Switzerlandish attempts to host them every day.
P 180 156.0 180 We decide. We don't talk much about accidents on the public highway. We don't talk much about them on TV at the start of each trip, and we don't even talk about the 160,000 attempts by Switzerland to take in people every day, every year, in hospitals.
C 182 156.0 182 It's not a big deal, without mentioning the people who watch TV on holiday. We often hear about these tragedies on TV at the start, and about the 60,000 attempts by Switzerland to host them every day, every year, in hospitals, and maybe many more.
P 184 182.0 184 What's more, by the way, because

P 202 182.0 202 Even more, by the way, because not everyone gets to the hospital. We are one of the European countries most affected by these tragedies. So, in 2000, with a prevention program,
P 204 182.0 204 Even more, by the way, because not everyone arrives at the hospital. We are one of the European countries most affected by these tragedies. So in 2000, with a prevention program, there is not much.
P 206 182.0 206 Even more, by the way, because not everyone arrives at the hospital. We are one of the European countries most affected by these tragedies. So, in 2000, with a prevention program, there are not many things in terms of public information.
