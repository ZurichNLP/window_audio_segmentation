P 589.65 581.65 589.65 But I make a small recommendation: we can lose ourselves on this path, because our trend is always to put ourselves in the shoes of others.
P 591.65 581.65 591.65 But a very small recommendation: on this path, we can get lost, because our tendency is always to put ourselves a little step above, a big step above.

P 37.49 35.49 37.49 Let me give you a copy.
C 38.38 35.49 38.38 For example, a couple was talking about change.

P 42.5 40.50 42.5 You have to change your attitude, right?
C 42.58 40.50 42.58 You have to change your attitude, right?
C 43.98 42.60 43.98 All you have to do is this: change.
P 46 44.00 46 It was a topic.
C 46.57 44.00 46.57 It was a central theme.
P 49 47.00 49 My colleagues introduced it to us.

C 51.32 47.00 51.32 But my colleagues presented it very clearly.
P 54.81 52.81 54.81 What's interesting about
P 56.81 52.81 56.81 What's interesting about change is that, as we've also said,
P 58.81 52.81 58.81 What's interesting about change is that, as we said before, it's not just a question of
P 60.81 52.81 60.81 What's interesting about change is that, as my colleague also said before, we all have to face it.
P 62.81 52.81 62.81 What's interesting about change is that, as my colleague said before, we all face change as if it were the
C 63.99 52.81 63.99 What's interesting about change is that, as my colleague said before, we all face change as if it were the most normal thing.
P 66.58 64.58 66.58 They say you have to change, that's normal.
P 68.58 64.58 68.58 They tell you that you have to change, that it's normal, that you have to do something.
C 68.96 64.58 68.96 They tell you that you have to change, that it's normal, that you have to do something.
P 71.18 69.18 71.18 But in reality, when you approach someone,
P 73.18 69.18 73.18 But in reality, when you approach change, the first thing you see is:
P 75.18 69.18 75.18 But, in reality, when you approach change, the first thing you have, besides fear, is that it's
P 77.18 69.18 77.18 But in reality, when you approach change, the first thing there is behind fear, you really feel your diversity.
P 79.18 69.18 79.18 But in reality, when you approach change, the first thing behind fear is that you really feel your diversity.

P 83.18 69.18 83.18 But in reality, when you approach change, the first thing there is behind fear, you feel your diversity, you experience your diversity, you feel far from the goal, you feel that in this change I am with you.
C 84.41 69.18 84.41 But in reality, when you approach change, the first thing behind fear is that you feel your diversity, you experience your diversity, you feel far from the goal, you feel that many people are involved in this change.

P 96.77 94.77 96.77 It seems that from this concept,

P 128.71 126.71 128.71 I looked at him and said, "OK, I was already there.
P 130.71 126.71 130.71 I looked at him and said, "OK, I was already puzzled by the question.
P 132.71 126.71 132.71 I looked at him and said, "OK, I was already puzzled by the question, but then you don't know what to answer, a child, especially if you're a kid."
C 133.3 126.71 133.3 I looked at him and said, "OK, I was already puzzled by the question, but you don't know what to answer, a son, especially if he's small."
C 135.64 133.72 135.64 I say, "Well, they both love each other."
P 138.83 136.83 138.83 So, this diversity, in reality, is really
P 140.83 136.83 140.83 So, this diversity, in fact, is precisely what we call "the call to make".
P 142.83 136.83 142.83 So, this diversity, in fact, is the calling to do something different.
P 144.83 136.83 144.83 So, this diversity, in fact, is the calling to do something different, to build something different.

P 152.83 136.83 152.83 So, this diversity is actually called to do something different, to build, to model, to find an answer that makes sense. And that's a bit the difficulty, though, because if on one hand you say, "I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do."

P 65.93 59.93 65.93 So, if life had disappeared on some other planet, around one of these stars?
P 67.93 59.93 67.93 So, if life had disappeared on some other planet, around one of these very ancient, therefore very short, stars?

P 71.93 59.93 71.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these very ancient stars, that were on Earth long before, it could have existed in the galaxy.
P 73.93 59.93 73.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these very old stars, that were on Earth long before, there could be, in the galaxy, incredible, intelligent species.
P 75.93 59.93 75.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, much earlier, on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours.
P 77.93 59.93 77.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, which was on Earth long before, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced than ours.
P 79.93 59.93 79.93 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, which was on Earth long before, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view.
C 81.91 59.93 81.91 So, if life had appeared on some other planet, around one of these stars, much earlier, on Earth, there could be, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from a technological point of view, millions of years older than us.
P 83.93 81.93 83.93 Maybe they're already traveling.
C 85.32 81.93 85.32 Maybe they're already traveling between the stars.
P 87.93 85.93 87.93 But we have never been like that.

P 94.04 92.04 94.04 Here's the question: "Where are you from?"
C 95.29 92.04 95.29 Here's the question: "Where are all of them?"
P 98.55 96.55 98.55 It's one thing, after all.
P 100.55 96.55 100.55 It's something that can create some curiosity.
C 101.5 96.55 101.5 It's something that can create some curiosity, it can be puzzling.
P 103.52 101.52 103.52 And in effect, in the course of time,
P 105.52 101.52 105.52 In fact, over the years, I've tried many approaches.
C 107.28 101.52 107.28 In fact, over the years, I have tried many approaches to answer this question.
P 109.3 107.30 109.3 Many possible ideas have been put forward.
P 111.3 107.30 111.3 There have been many possible proposals and answers, some very fantastic.
P 113.3 107.30 113.3 There have been many possible proposals and answers, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no such thing.
P 115.3 107.30 115.3 Many possible answers have been offered, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
C 115.67 107.30 115.67 Many possible answers have been offered, some very fantastic, but the simplest is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
C 118.02 116.61 118.02 So, this is possible.
P 120.96 118.96 120.96 I think this is a question we've all asked ourselves.
C 122.46 118.96 122.46 I think this is a question that we have all asked ourselves in our lives.
C 124.6 122.69 124.6 I, at least, have always done it.
