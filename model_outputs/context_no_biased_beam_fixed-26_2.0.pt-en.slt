P 14 0.0 14 (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) We'd like to start with "Comum Universal" here, 35,000. What do you think is funny about this guy?
P 16 0.0 16 (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) I'd like to start with you guys. (Applause) I'd like to start with you guys. 35,000. What do you think is awesome? This number is the
P 18 0.0 18 (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) I want to start with you guys: 35,000. What do you think this number means? This number is the number of
P 20 0.0 20 (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) I want to start with you guys. 35,000, what do you think is awesome? This number is the number of decisions made every year, taken as a guide.
P 22 0.0 22 (Laughter) (Applause) I want to start with you guys. 35,000. What do you think this movie is about? This number is the number of decisions on a season, it's about twice a week. And it's more or less one decision every
P 24 0.0 24 (Laughter) (Applause) I'd like to start with you guys. 35,000, what do you think is awesome? This number is the amount of decisions made on a weekly run, and it's more or less one decision every two seconds, that a person makes.
C 26 0.0 26 (Laughter) (Applause) Do you want to start with me? 35,000? What do you think is fake news? This number is the number of decisions on a serum, a curve, and it's more or less one decision every two seconds, that person, one, two, you have to
P 28 26.0 28 What's the decision? Is it
P 30 26.0 30 It's a decision. Wait, I'm supposed to be here in the audience.
P 32 26.0 32 Let's make a decision. I hope it's a good decision. (Laughter) Let's talk about the decisions I want to tell you.
P 34 26.0 34 I'd like to tell you a story about my decision. I'd like to tell you a story about a woman
P 36 26.0 36 I'd like to tell you a story that changed my mind. One of the decisions changed my mind.
P 38 26.0 38 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed my mind. When I saw one of the decisions, it changed my mind.
P 40 26.0 40 I'd like to tell you a story about a decision that changed my mind about making a decision. It's an experiment that was done with a journalist
P 42 26.0 42 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my mind. I saw one of the decisions, it changed my mind to make a decision. It's an experiment that was done with the
P 44 26.0 44 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story. One of the decisions changed my mind when I took the decision. It's an experiment that was done with the Ikea magazine. The magazine's outsiders have three
P 46 26.0 46 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story. One of the decisions that came to my mind changed my turn to make a decision. It's an experiment that was done with the Ikea magazine. The magazine's fans have three notions of this nature: a digital
P 48 26.0 48 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story. One of the decisions changed my mind when I made it. It's an experiment made by the Ikea magazine. The magazine's founders have three notions of this nature: a digital sculpture with 50 dollars,
P 50 26.0 50 I'd like to tell you a story about decisions that changed my mind. One of the decisions changed my mind, it changed my mind to make decisions. It's an experiment that was done with a magazine called "Iron Man." The magazine's links have three notions in this nature: a digital structure, 50 years old, and a press structure.
C 52 26.0 52 (Laughter) Speaking of decisions, I'd like to tell you a story about a woman who saw one of the decisions and changed my way of making decisions. It's an experiment that was done with a magazine called "Young Woman". The magazine's headlines have three notions of nature: a digital structure, 50 years old; a printed magazine structure, 65 years old; and a
P 54 52.0 54 This person is like a digital plus
P 56 52.0 56 This person is like a digital plus print, and also a storyteller.
P 58 52.0 58 It's like a digital plus print, another seven small stories. The result of this
P 60 52.0 60 It's like a digital plus print, another seven small photos. The challenge of this experiment is that the majority of people
P 62 52.0 62 It's a digital plus print, another seven small photos. The challenge of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how to
P 64 52.0 64 It's a digital plus print, another seven small photos. The challenge of this experiment is that the majority of people chose the "com" for US$ 55.
P 66 52.0 66 This book is a digital plus print, another seven small photos. The challenge of this experiment is that the majority of people chose the "com" for US$ 55. I like these experiments a lot,
P 68 52.0 68 It's like a digital plus print, another seven small photos. The challenge of this difference is that the vast majority of people chose "How" for USD 55. What I really like about these experiments is that there are usually two
P 70 52.0 70 The lab is like a digital plus print, another seven-pic-toos. The challenge of this difference is that the vast majority of people chose "How" for 5,000 dollars. What I really like about these experiments is that there are usually two groups. But is there a second group?
P 72 52.0 72 The magazine is a digital "how" more impressive than any other seven-picture. The challenge of this difference is that the vast majority of people chose "how" for US$ 5,000. What I like most of these experiments is that they generally belong to two groups. For the second group, only two notions were included.
P 74 52.0 74 The lab is a digital plus-printing "how" for seven small photos. The challenge of this difference is that the vast majority of people chose "how" for the 75 dollars. What I like most of these experiments is that, generally, there are two groups. But for the second group, only two ideas were offered: the idea of
P 76 52.0 76 This box is a digital plus-printing box with seven pictograms. The challenge of this exercise is that the vast majority of people chose how to use these experiments for 5,000 dollars. I like these experiments a lot, it's that there are usually two groups. For the second group, only two options were offered: a digital option for 5,000 dollars, and a
C 78 52.0 78 A car is a digital plus print, also a "sepetitive" car. The challenge of this exercise is that the vast majority of people chose to buy a car with a 75 dollar price. I like these experiments a lot, generally, because there are two groups. For the second group, only two notions were mentioned: the idea of a digital car with a 50 dollar price, and the option of buying a car with a 100 dollar price.
P 80 78.0 80 (Applause) And what interested me?
P 82 78.0 82 And what's interesting to me is that for this group of people, the biggest
P 84 78.0 84 (Applause) And what's interesting is that for this group of people, the majority chose the digital option.
P 86 78.0 86 And what's interesting is that for this group of people, the majority chose a digital option.
P 88 78.0 88 And what's interesting is that here, for this group of people, the majority chose a digital option. When I talk about these experiments, I'm
P 90 78.0 90 And what's interesting to me is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about this experiment, I'm thinking, "What's the option of money, of
P 92 78.0 92 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments, I'm thinking, "What's the solution of the middle, of certain
P 94 78.0 94 And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments, you're thinking, "And what about the solution of the middle, of the serendipity, of the press?" Nobody looked at
P 96 78.0 96 (Laughter) And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they tell me about these experiments, you're thinking, "And what's the choice of the middle, of selfies and printed balloons?" Nobody chose this option.
P 98 78.0 98 (Laughter) And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they talk to me about these experiments, they say, "Aren't you? And what's the solution?" "Siren Involved, print your results." No one chose it. Why did this option change most people?
P 100 78.0 100 (Laughter) And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When they tell me about these experiments, they say, "Aren't you? And what's the middle of the solution?" "Siren Involved, print your opinion," which no one chose. Why did this option change? Most of them chose another one.
P 102 78.0 102 (Laughter) And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When he tells me about his experiments, like Hansen, and the "Mio" option, of "Sërvilha," a printed label, that nobody chose, why did this option change? Most of them chose one option, and this left me very unhappy.
C 104 78.0 104 (Laughter) And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option. When he tells me about his experiments, he says, "Sandy, and it's the half-meow, half-printed, "self-colored" solution, that nobody chose that option, why did most of them choose one? And this left me very disconcerted, because what I'd like to
P 106 104.0 106 What would have been this decision?
P 108 104.0 108 What would I do with this decision? I started to study about it.
P 110 104.0 110 What would have made me make this decision? I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that it's
P 112 104.0 112 What would have been this decision? And I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that it has even a name. It's called
P 114 104.0 114 What would have made me make this decision? And I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this idea has even a name. It's called Ticoe. It's a
P 116 104.0 116 I made this decision, and I started to study it. I studied it, and I discovered that this idea has a name. It's called "Dicoe," a person who's put in an equation to influence
P 118 104.0 118 What happened to me when I made this decision? I started to study it. I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this half name of the solution is called COO. It's a solution that's put in an equation to influence people when they make a decision.
P 120 104.0 120 I thought I'd make this decision, and I started to study it. I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this half name of the solution, it's called COO, is a solution that's put in an equation to influence a person's decision.
P 122 104.0 122 I thought I'd make this decision, and I started to study it. I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this half-year-old idea has a name, it's called "Dicoe," or it's going to be put in an equation to influence a decision. I learned a lot about this from a theory called
P 124 104.0 124 I thought I'd make this decision, and I started to study it. I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this half-year-old idea has a name, it's called "Dicoe," it's to be put in an equation to influence how one makes a decision or another. And I learned a lot about this from a theory called
P 126 104.0 126 And I started to study about it. I studied it a lot, and I discovered that this half name is called Tico, it's a name that's put in an equation to influence how people make one decision or another. And I learned a lot about this from a theory called "Education and Technology," a theory that studies cognitive psychology.
P 128 104.0 128 I thought I'd make a better decision, and I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this half name is Dico, it's a name that's put in an equation to influence how people make one decision or another. I learned a lot about this from a theory called "ecology and planetary economy," by the theory that studies cognitive biology and neuroscience applied to
C 130 104.0 130 And I started to study about it. I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this half name is Tico, it's a term that's put in an equation to influence how people make one decision or another. And I learned a lot about this from a theory called economic and environmental theory, the theory that studies cognitive ecology and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
P 132 130.0 132 (Laughter) It's interesting,
P 134 130.0 134 It's interesting, you'd like to use it, but you'd
P 136 130.0 136 It's interesting, you might use it, but you have two options.
P 138 130.0 138 It's interesting, you can use it, but there are two options for the iPad. And you want people to choose
P 140 130.0 140 It's interesting, you can use it, but there are two options for the iPad, and you want people to choose the iPad. You're a
P 142 130.0 142 It's interesting, you might have used it, but there are two options for the iPad, and you want people to choose the one you like. You're a young person, you're less good at the option.
P 144 130.0 144 It's interesting, you've probably guessed it, but there are two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the option T. If you're young, you're less good at it. If you're at least
P 146 130.0 146 It's interesting, you can use it, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the option T. You're a youngster, and you're less good at it. That's what makes the zombie seem better for those
P 148 130.0 148 It's interesting, I'm going to show you some spreadsheets, but you have two options on the iPad, and you want people to choose the Sunset. You're a young person, and you're less good at school. This makes the Sunset seem better for those who will always pay USD 25 on
P 150 130.0 150 It's interesting, I'm going to show you some spreadsheets, but you have two options, and you want people to choose the option B. You're a youngster, you're less good at the end of the year. This option makes the option B seem better for those who will always pay between two and five dollars on a paper, if I can have
P 152 130.0 152 It's interesting, I'm going to show you some spreadsheets, but Uber has two options, and you want people to choose Uber. You want the youngsters to be less good at Apple. This option makes the Uber look better for those who are going to pay 25 dollars on a printed sound, if I can have two for each one. (Applause)
P 154 130.0 154 It's interesting, I'm going to show you some spreadsheets, but you have two options, and you want people to choose Sunset. You're a youngster, and it makes Sunset look better. For those who will pay less than 25 dollars on a printed sound, I can have two for
C 156 130.0 156 It's interesting, I'm going to show you some spreadsheets, but there are two options, and you want people to choose the Sunset. You want the Sunset to look better, so that someone who's going to pay 25 dollars for a Sunset in a printed sound can have two more Sunsets. This is amazing, right? Because I've come to ask myself why all of this?
P 158 156.0 158 And a talk that included
P 160 156.0 160 And in a talk that I included on YouTube, I made it all online.
P 162 156.0 162 And a talk that included YouTube made me use of the Internet. When I got to the talk, he made me
P 164 156.0 164 And a talk that included Deutsche Telekom made me use of the Internet. When a talk was made, he made a comparison
P 166 156.0 166 One talk, including that of Terry Walsh, made me think of it all. One talk made him make a comparison between these behaviors and the most orthopedic ones.
P 168 156.0 168 And a talk, including from Terry Walsh, made me all interested. Another talk made a comparison between these two approaches with the aesthetic one. I think everyone here in this room
P 170 156.0 170 And in a talk that included Terry Walsh and made it all interconnected, he made a comparison of these combinations with the Nestlé group. I think everyone is part of this group.
P 172 156.0 172 And in a talk that included Terry Walsh and made it all online, he made a comparison between these two combinations with the most orthopedic helium. I think everyone is part of the same group. The blue to the left circle seems
P 174 156.0 174 And in a talk that included tennis and made it all online, a guy made a comparison of these combinations with the New Yorkers. I think everyone shares the same stereotype. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right.
P 176 156.0 176 And in a lecture, which included tennis and made internet all about it, a guy made a comparison of these combinations with the Japanese. I think everyone is part of the Japanese. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right.
P 178 156.0 178 And in a talk that included tennis and made me a fan, he made a comparison of these combinations with the New Yorkers. I think everyone belongs to the New Yorkers. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. OK? Because I have around
P 180 156.0 180 And in a talk, which included tennis and made it on the Internet, a guy made a comparison of these combinations with the New Yorkers. I think everyone belongs to the New Yorkers. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. OK? Because I have around me, it makes us see things differently.
C 182 156.0 182 And in a talk that I gave on the Internet, a woman even made a comparison of these combinations with the Nazis. I think everyone belongs to the Nazis. The blue circle on the left looks a little bigger than the blue circle on the right. What I have around me makes us look differently. The truth is that the Nazis
P 184 182.0 184 Well, but we see it and
P 186 182.0 186 Well, but we see it with a x-axis, the one around us.
P 188 182.0 188 But we see it as a way of influencing each other.
P 190 182.0 190 Well, but we can see it and see how it can affect us. There's another idea in Europe that you can't ignore
P 192 182.0 192 Well, we see it as a way of influencing each other. There's another idea that makes you think when I see it, which is this one here.
P 194 182.0 194 Well, we see it as a way of influencing each other, because what's around us can influence us. There's another idea from Europe that I'll make you believe when I see it, which is this one. The pieces we're
P 196 182.0 196 Well, we see it as a way of influencing each other. There's another example from Europe that makes me believe when I see it, which is this one. The pieces of the top board are the same as the pieces of the
P 198 182.0 198 Well, we see it as a way of influencing each other. There's another example in Europe that will make you believe when I see it, which is here. The chess pieces from above are the same as the chess pieces from below.
P 200 182.0 200 Well, but we see it as a way of interacting because it can influence us. There's another example in Europe that will make me believe when I see it, which is here. The chess pieces from above are equal to the chess pieces from below. That's when my friend
P 202 182.0 202 Well, but we see it as a problem because it's influencing us all around. There's another example in Europe that makes me believe, when I saw it, that's here. The chess pieces from above are the same as the chess pieces from below. At that point, the guy said, "I have a problem with the way
P 204 182.0 204 Well, but we see it as a way of influencing us. There's another example in Europe that makes me believe, which is here. The chess pieces from above are equal to the chess pieces from below. At this point, the guy says, "I have a problem with how I handle all this, but I'll show you
P 206 182.0 206 Well, we see it as a way of influencing each other. There's another example in New York that makes me laugh, which is this one. The chess pieces from above are equal to the chess pieces from below. At this point, he says, "I've got a problem with the way I handle all this, but I'll show you that it's true."
C 208 182.0 208 Well, but we see it as a way of influencing us. There's another example in New York, which I'll explain when I see it, and it's this one. The chess pieces from the top are the same as the chess pieces from the bottom. At this point, they say, "I've got a problem with the way I handle all this, but I'll show you that I'm
P 210 208.0 210 In the pieces, it's just the bottom.
P 212 208.0 212 In the parties, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really cool.
P 214 208.0 214 In the parties, it's only when we're deep down that we see they're really good.
P 216 208.0 216 It's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really good. When I saw this presentation,
P 218 208.0 218 In the shows, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really gay. When I saw this presentation, I really understood, and it
P 220 208.0 220 In the plays, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood, and it makes some sense to say that there are
P 222 208.0 222 In plays, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood, and it makes some sense to say that what's around us influences us.
P 224 208.0 224 In the plays, it's only when they're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood, and it makes some sense to say that what's around us influences us. From the real picture that's around
P 226 208.0 226 In the pieces, it's only when they're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood and it makes some sense to say that what's around us influences us. From the same spot that's around, we can see things, what's around
P 228 208.0 228 In the plays, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood and it makes some sense to say that what's around us influences us. From the same photo that's around us influences the way we see things, what's around us also
P 230 208.0 230 In the plays, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood and it makes some sense to say that what's around us influences us. From the same photo that's around us influences the way we see things, what's around us also generates a lot of decisions.
P 232 208.0 232 In plays, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood and it made some sense to us to say that what's around us has an influence. From the same photo that's around us that influences the way we see things, what's around us has also born into a kind of decision-making technology.
C 234 208.0 234 In the plays, it's only when we're deep down that we see that they're really cool. When I saw this presentation, I really understood and it makes some sense to say that what's around us influences us. From the same photo that's around us influences the way we see things, what's around us has also born into a kind of decision-making technology. I'm an expert in
P 236 234.0 236 So, to create a
P 238 234.0 238 to create an organization for security. And we were
P 240 234.0 240 And we were like, "Wow, that's hard, it's difficult."
P 242 234.0 242 We're going to create an open source for video games. We're going to say, "The script is difficult, it's a lot of options, and we can't choose it."
P 244 234.0 244 It's the right one to create a video game for video games. We're going to be like, "The script is difficult, it's a lot of options, and we can't choose from it." You can choose
P 246 234.0 246 It's the right one to create an image through digits. We're going to say, "The script is difficult, there's a lot of options, and we can't choose from them." Can you choose these two, three, or two options?
P 248 234.0 248 You can choose one, two, three, or two options. And in a second event,
P 250 234.0 250 It's the right one to create a publication through these graphs. We'll be able to see how hard it is, there are many options, and we won't be able to choose from them. You can choose these graphs, two, three, or two. And in a second safe event, we were working
P 252 234.0 252 We have a project to create a publication through these codes. We're going to see how hard it is to write, there are many options, and we won't be able to choose from them. You can choose these codes, two, three or two. And in a seventh safe event, we were working on, they said, "511
P 254 234.0 254 It's a project to create a publication through these digits. We'll be able to see how difficult it is, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to choose from them. You can choose from these two, three, or two options. And in a seventh safe event, we were working on, there were 511 possibilities of choice.
P 256 234.0 256 It's the right way to create a publication through these codes. We're going to have to face the figures, it's hard, there's a lot of options, and we won't be able to choose from them. You can choose these codes, two, three, or two. And in a seventh safe event, we were working, they said, "There are 511 possibilities of choice." And here's where I'm talking to
P 258 234.0 258 It's a project to create a publication through these codes. We're going to see how hard it is, it's a lot of options, and we won't be able to choose from them. You can pick these codes, two, three, or two, and in a seventh safe event, we were working on them, there were 511 possibilities of choice. And here's where I'm going to choose a simple
C 260 234.0 260 It's a project to create an education through these values. We're going to have to face a difficult situation. It's a lot of options, and we won't be able to choose from them. You can choose these values, two, three, or two. And in a seventh safe event, we were working on it, we identified 51 possibilities of choice. And here's where I'm going to choose a simple way of choosing for people.
P 262 260.0 262 This way, we'll have another profession.
