Herman, which is a newspaper that D. E. Herman published in the 80s when he was diagnosed with ADHD and decided to go back to his childhood passion.
P 74 52.0 74 That's what we're going to do now. And what I was thinking about is an idea I was meditating on from a book called "Modern Nature" by the designer Drexlerman. These are the newspapers Drexlerman took in the 80s, when he was diagnosed with HIV, and then decides to go back to his childhood, to gardening. Drexlerman is a filmmaker.

These are the newspapers D. E. Herman took in the 80s when he was diagnosed with H.E.V. and then decides to go back to his childhood, to gardening. D. E. Herman is a physiotherapist, in fact, after studying the diagnosis.

P 112 104.0 112 We thought, "Well, although this is all we do, it's to wash dishes, not the only tasks allowed are these." And we thought about the concept of work.

P 116 104.0 116 We thought, "Well, all we do is wash dishes, not the only tasks allowed are those." And then we thought about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
P 118 104.0 118 We thought, "Well, all we do here is to wash dishes, not the only tasks that we are allowed to do are those." And we thought then about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo, from Frédéric Genscher, basically.
P 120 104.0 120 We thought, "Well, this is all we do is to wash dishes, not the only tasks that we are allowed to do are those."

P 122 104.0 122 We thought, "Well, although this is all we do, it's to wash dishes, not the only tasks that are allowed are those," and we thought then about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo, from Frédéric Hänger, basically, and that later takes especially feminist machismo to talk about reproductive work.
P 124 104.0 124 We thought, "Well, this is all we do, it's making dishes, not the only tasks that are allowed are those." And we thought about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of sexism, from Frédéric Jangels, basically, and which later took on, especially, the feminist Marxism, to talk about reproductive work, isn't it just productive work?
P 126 104.0 126 We thought, "Well, this is the only thing we do, it's making dishes, not the only tasks that we're allowed to do are those." And we thought about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo, from Frédéric Jangels, basically, and that later takes up, especially, the feminist march, to talk about reproductive work, isn't it reproductive work that puts new things in the world?
P 128 104.0 128 We thought, "Well, this is all we do, it's making dishes, not the only tasks allowed to us are those." And we thought about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo, from Freud and Gengels, basically, and that later we take, especially from the feminist Marxism, to talk about reproductive work. It's not just productive work, it's the one that puts new things in the world, we can say.
C 130 104.0 130 We thought, "Well, this is all we do, it's making dishes, not the only tasks allowed are those." And we thought then about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo, especially from the feminist feminist Frédéric Genscher, to talk about reproductive work. It's not about reproductive work, which is the one that puts new things in the world, we can say, whether it's a job for a father or a clown, it doesn't matter.

P 134 130.0 134 And this is the reproductive work that reproduces the conditions for us to do that.

P 140 130.0 140 And this is the reproductive work that reproduces the conditions for us to do that: clean, cook, take care, basically, cook for the workers.
P 142 130.0 142 And this is reproductive work, which reproduces the conditions for us to do that: clean, cook, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory, that's their job.
P 144 130.0 144 And this reproductive work reproduces the conditions for us to do this: clean, cook, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory, that's reproductive work.
P 146 130.0 146 And this reproductive work reproduces the conditions for us to do this: clean, cook, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory, that's reproductive work, and we feminists have been doing this for a long time now.
P 148 130.0 148 And this reproductive work reproduces the conditions for us to do this: clean, cook, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory - this is reproductive work - and we feminists have been arguing about it for a long time.
P 150 130.0 150 And this reproductive work reproduces the conditions for us to do this: clean, cook, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory - this is reproductive work - and we feminists have been arguing for a long time that reproductive work too.
P 152 130.0 152 And this is reproductive work, which creates the conditions for us to do this: clean, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory, that's reproductive work, and we, as feminists, have been arguing for a long time that reproductive work is also work.
P 154 130.0 154 And this reproductive work is what creates the conditions for us to do this: clean, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory, that's reproductive work, and we, as feminists, have been arguing for a long time, correctly, that reproductive work is also work, but in general, it's work that we produce.
C 156 130.0 156 And this reproductive work is what creates the conditions for us to do this: clean, take care, basically, cook the workers so that the next day they can go to the factory, right? And we feminists took a long time to argue that reproductive work is also work, but in general, what we produce, what we argue about, is that
P 158 156.0 158 reproductive work has value.
P 160 156.0 160 Because reproductive work has economic value, why does it serve to make a living?
P 162 156.0 162 reproductive work has economic value because it can be used for productive work, because if the jobs don't eat, they don't.
P 164 156.0 164 Because reproductive work has economic value because it serves to do productive work, because if the jobs don't eat, they don't eat in the factory.
P 166 156.0 166 Because reproductive work has economic value, because it serves to make productive work, because if the workers don't eat, they don't eat in the factory. Now, why do we think of this value?
P 168 156.0 168 Because reproductive work has economic value, because it serves to make productive work, because if the workers don't eat, they don't eat in the factory. Now, why should we think of this relative value, first, we don't think of a value?
P 170 156.0 170 Well, reproductive work has economic value because it serves to make productive work, because if jobs don't eat, they don't in factories. Now, why instead of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value, and even more?
P 172 156.0 172 Well, reproductive work has economic value because it serves to make productive work, because if the workers don't eat in the factory, now, why instead of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value, and even more, why don't we do it like Hersman did?
P 174 156.0 174 Well, reproductive work has economic value because it serves to make productive work, because if the workers don't eat in the factory, now, why instead of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value, and even more, why don't we do what Hersman did and think that's the difference?
P 176 156.0 176 Well, reproductive work has economic value because it's meant to be productive work, because if the workers don't eat in the factory, why not, first, think of absolute value, and even more, why not do we, as did Herman, think that there is a difference, a contrast, between work and family?
P 178 156.0 178 Well, reproductive work has economic value because it's useful to do it, because if the workers don't eat in the factory, first, why don't we think about absolute value, and even more, why don't we think like Erkman and think that this difference, this contrast between productive and reproductive work is a difference?
P 180 156.0 180 Well, reproductive work has economic value because it serves to make productive work, because if the workers don't eat, they don't eat at the factory. First, why don't we think about absolute value, like Hersman did, and think that this difference, this contrast between productive work and reproductive work is a more infectious difference?
C 182 156.0 182 If you think that productive work has economic value because it serves to be productive work, because if the workers don't eat, they don't eat at the factory, then why don't we think about absolute value, first, and second, why don't we think that this difference, this contrast between productive work and reproductive work is a more infectious difference given by one side?
P 184 182.0 184 Gender, of course, because of the idea that I had.

P 196 182.0 196 It's a matter of gender, of the idea that productive tasks traditionally performed by men and reproductive ones traditionally performed by women are important, and it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject
P 198 182.0 198 Gender is important, of course, because of the idea that productive tasks are traditionally performed by men, and reproductive tasks traditionally performed by women are important, and it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject is almost something original.
P 200 182.0 200 It's a matter of gender, of the idea that important productive tasks are traditionally performed by women, and reproductive tasks are traditionally performed by important women, and it's also given by modernity and by the idea that the person who's worth it is the person who's almost the original, who produces good worth in the world, and the one who takes care of it.
P 202 182.0 202 Gender balance, of course, by the idea that important productive tasks are traditionally performed by women, and reproductive tasks traditionally performed by women are important, and also given by modernity and by the idea that the person who's worth it is the almost original person who generates honor in the world, where the person takes care of you, right?
P 204 182.0 204 Gender, of course, because of the idea that there are important productive tasks traditionally performed by women, and reproductive tasks traditionally performed by women are important, and also because of the idea that the person who's worth it is the very original person who produces goodwill in the world, and that the person who takes care of you is something that doesn't make you special.
P 206 182.0 206 Gender, of course, because of the idea that there are important productive tasks traditionally performed by women, and reproductive tasks traditionally performed by women are important, and also because of the idea that the subject that's worth it is almost something original, that generates courage in the world, and that the subject that takes care of you is something that doesn't make you special, doesn't make you an artist.
C 208 182.0 208 Gender, of course, because of the idea that there are important productive tasks traditionally performed by women, and reproductive tasks traditionally performed by women are important, and also because of modernity and the idea that the subject is almost something original in the world, and that the subject takes care of you is something that doesn't make you special, doesn't make you original, doesn't make you an artist, or an important person.
P 210 208.0 210 These are values with which we interact.
P 212 208.0 212 These are values with which we don't have a common sense.
P 214 208.0 214 Those are values that we don't have a common goal with, let's think about the other way around.
P 216 208.0 216 Those are values we don't have a common goal with, let's think the other way around, that care work is the most important.
P 218 208.0 218 Those are values that we don't have to share with the community. Think about it the other way around, saying that care work is the most important.
P 220 208.0 220 Those are values that we don't have to share with the local community. Think about it the other way around, saying that care work is the most important if we are living without political activists or writers.
P 222 208.0 222 Those are values that we don't have a common place with. Think about it the other way around, saying that care work is the most important, if we're living these days without publicists, without writers, without a lot.
P 224 208.0 224 Those are values that we don't have anywhere. Think about it the other way around, and say, care work is the most important, without advertisers, without writers, without a lot of things, we're living without PowerPoint.
P 226 208.0 226 These are values that we don't have anywhere. Think about it the other way around, and say, "Work as a caretaker is the most important thing, without paying attention to what we're doing." We're living without paying attention to what we're doing, and the world is spinning.
P 228 208.0 228 These are values that we don't have a place with. Think about it the other way around, say, care work is the most important, without a lot of writers, we're living without a lot of publicity, without paying attention, and the world keeps spinning, but the world wouldn't keep spinning with me.
P 230 208.0 230 Those are values that we don't have as a place to live. Think about it the other way round, saying care work is the most important, without a lot of people, without writers. We're living without a lot of publicity, without paying attention, and the world is still spinning, but the world wouldn't be spinning without me, without care, and without sickness.
P 232 208.0 232 These are values that we don't have as a place to live. Think about it the other way around, saying that care work is the most important, without publicists, without writers, we're living without a lot of things, without PowerPoint, and the world is still spinning, but the world wouldn't be spinning without me, without care, and without nurses, and without health.
C 234 208.0 234 These are values that we don't have as a place to live. Think about it the other way around, and say, care work is the most important, without 'paugar points', without writers. We're living without a lot of things, without publicists and without the world, but the world wouldn't go round without me, without care, without nurses, and without health. The only thing that allows us today is to eat.
P 236 234.0 236 To heal and heal.
P 238 234.0 238 It's healing and healing, and cleaning, and without that world.
P 240 234.0 240 It's healing and healing, and cleaning, and it's not a world of surgery.
P 242 234.0 242 To heal and clean, and without this world of surgery, then, these tasks have an impact.
P 244 234.0 244 So, these tasks have a value that is not relative, they have a value.
P 246 234.0 246 So, these tasks have a value that is not relative, they have an absolute value, and not only that.
P 248 234.0 248 So, these tasks have a value that is not relative, they have an absolute value, and not only that, they are not something mechanical.
P 250 234.0 250 So, these tasks have a value that is not relative, they have an absolute value, and not only that, they are not something mechanical that we need to go through.
P 252 234.0 252 So, these tasks have a value that is not relative, they have an absolute value, and not only that, but they are not something mechanical that we need to go through, that I wish it didn't exist.
P 254 234.0 254 So, these tasks have a value that's not relative, they have an absolute value, and not only that, but they're not something mechanical, that we need to go through, that I wish it didn't exist, that maybe you could do it like this, clean it almost.
P 256 234.0 256 So, these tasks have a value that is not relative, they have an absolute value, and not only that, but they are not a mechanical thing that we necessarily have to go through, that I wish it didn't exist, that someone could pick it up, clean it, cook it, and solve it.
P 258 234.0 258 So, these tasks have a non-relative value, they have an absolute value, and not only that, but that they're not something mechanical that we necessarily have to go through, that I wish it didn't exist, that someone could do it like this, clean it, cook it, and solve the problem. We can think of it like this.
C 260 234.0 260 So, these tasks have a non-relative value, they have an absolute value, and they're not just something mechanical that we need to go through, that I wish it didn't exist, that someone could do it like this, clean it, cook, and solve the problem, they can be thought like this, we've been thinking about them for a long time.
P 262 260.0 262 (Laughter) But what I thought
P 264 260.0 264 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Yormains" is what?
P 266 260.0 266 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read to Germaine is that we can also live.
P 268 260.0 268 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read to Germans is that we can also live them in a different way.
P 270 260.0 270 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read to Germans is that we can also live them differently, we can live them as tasks that have to be done.
P 272 260.0 272 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read to Germans is that we can also live them in a different way, we can live them as tasks that have a wisdom.
P 274 260.0 274 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Harman" is that we can also live them differently, we can live them as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks in which we are also involved.
P 276 260.0 276 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Harman" is that we can also live them differently, as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks in which we are also involved as human beings.
P 278 260.0 278 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Harman" is that we can also live them differently, as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks in which we are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical.
P 280 260.0 280 But what I thought when I read Harvard is that we can live them differently, as tasks that have a wisdom, tasks in which we are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with this.
P 282 260.0 282 But what I thought when I read Harvard is that we can also live them differently, as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks in which we are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with what he calls modern nature, modern fashion.
P 284 260.0 284 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Harman" is that we can also live them differently, as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks in which we are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with compensating for what he calls, not modern nature, modernity, but the human being.
C 286 260.0 286 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read Harvard is that we can also live them differently, as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks in which we are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with compensating for this, not modern nature, not modernity as a human being separated from the natural world.
P 288 286.0 288 But it's not only that.
P 290 286.0 290 It's a way of doing something interesting with nature when I share it.
P 292 286.0 292 I don't think that it only does something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else.
P 294 286.0 294 I don't think it's just something interesting to do with nature when you turn it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature.
P 296 286.0 296 It doesn't mean only doing something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature is also something interesting.
P 298 286.0 298 It's true that it's only interesting to do something with nature when it turns it into something else, but the caring relationship with nature is also interesting, the caring relationship with our bodies.
P 300 286.0 300 It doesn't mean that we only do something interesting with nature when we turn it into something else, but that the relationship of care with nature is also something interesting, the relationship of care with our bodies, we usually think that we have to take care of them.
P 302 286.0 302 It's true that we only do something interesting with nature when we turn it into something else, but the caring relationship with nature is also something interesting, the caring relationship with our bodies, we usually think that we have to care about our bodies.
P 304 286.0 304 It's true that we only do something interesting with nature when we turn it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature is also something interesting, the relationship of care with our bodies, we usually think that we have to look into the body, and in the gym, we have to cook.

P 166 156.0 166 But this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight and give us a taste of our health, because the food is seized.
P 168 156.0 168 But this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's going to be a gift to our health, because the harvested food is unique to its time.
P 170 156.0 170 But this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's going to be a gift to our health, because the harvested food, that was unique at the time, is the most natural food.

P 174 156.0 174 Well, this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's going to be a gift to our health, because the seized food of its time is the most natural food, it's the most nutrient-rich food, and it's not so bad.
P 176 156.0 176 But this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's going to be a gift to our health, because the harvested food of its own time is the most natural food, the most nutrient-rich food, and it's not chemically treated.
P 178 156.0 178 But this is going to guarantee us control and balance in our weight, and it's going to be a gift to our health, because the harvested foods of their own time are the richest natural foods in nutrients, and they're not chemically treated to survive in time.
P 180 156.0 180 But this is going to guarantee us control and balance in our weight, and it's going to be a gift to our health, because the harvested foods of their own time are the richest foods in nutrients, and they're not chemically treated to survive in time, that is, they're not added with heat.
C 182 156.0 182 Well, this is going to guarantee us control and balance of our weight, and it's going to be a gift to our health, and it's not because the most cherished foods of their time are the most naturally treated foods, chemically, to survive in time, that is, they're not added calories.

P 220 208.0 220 One of the most important is moderation, for those who don't get out of bed because they're not hungry, because they don't have time, because many times they are starved.

P 236 234.0 236 So, what do I mean by that?
P 238 234.0 238 So, what do I mean by that? That hunger accumulates.
P 240 234.0 240 So, what do I mean by this? That hunger accumulates, that hunger is not to be manipulated.
P 242 234.0 242 So what I mean by this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if it is restricted.
P 244 234.0 244 So what I want to say with this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if you restrict food, if you jump food.
P 246 234.0 246 So what I mean by this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food is restricted, if food is salted, what is not consumed.
P 248 234.0 248 So what I mean by this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food is restricted, if food is salted, what is not consumed during the day is consumed in the afternoon.
P 250 234.0 250 So what I want to say with this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food is restricted, if food is spilled, what is not consumed during the day is consumed in the afternoon or at night, and in a double proportion.
P 252 234.0 252 So what I want to say with this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food is restricted, if food is salted, what is not consumed during the day is consumed in the afternoon or at night, and in double proportion. To be more graphical, it's like a penis.
P 254 234.0 254 So what I want to say with this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food isn't restricted, if food isn't salted, what isn't consumed during the day is consumed in the afternoon or at night, and in double proportion, it's like a snowball that comes from above.
P 256 234.0 256 So what I want to say with this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food isn't restricted, if food isn't salted, what isn't consumed during the day, or at night, is consumed twice as much. To be more graphical, it's like a snowball that comes from above, each time with more snow.
P 258 234.0 258 So, what I want to say with this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food isn't restricted, if food isn't salted, what isn't consumed in the day, or in the afternoon, or at night, and in double proportion, to make it more graphical, it's like a snowball that comes from above, each time with more size, each time with more volume.
C 260 234.0 260 So, what I want to say with this is that hunger accumulates, that hunger is unmanageable if food isn't restricted, if food isn't salty, if food isn't consumed in the day or at night, to be more graphic, it's like a snowball coming from above, every time with more size, every time with more volume, and every time with more strength.
P 262 260.0 262 (Laughter) So, if not, let's stop.
P 264 260.0 264 (Laughter) So if we don't, we stop each three, four times.
P 266 260.0 266 (Laughter) So, if not, we stop every three, four hours to take a nap.
P 268 260.0 268 (Laughter) So, what if we don't stop ourselves every three or four hours to drink a drink?
P 270 260.0 270 (Laughter) So if we don't stop every three or four hours to drink a drink, that snowball will deflate.
P 272 260.0 272 (Laughter) So if we don't stop every three or four hours to drink a drink, that snowball will deflate in a borax way in the first half.
P 274 260.0 274 (Laughter) So if we don't stop every three or four hours to drink a drink, that snowball will deflate in a boraz way at the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
P 276 260.0 276 (Laughter) So if we don't stop ourselves every three or four hours to have a snack, that snowball will deflate in a boraz way at the first time we have the opportunity to eat, and we'll deflate.
P 278 260.0 278 (Laughter) So if we don't stop ourselves every three or four hours to have a snack, that snowball will deflate in a boraz way at the first time we have the opportunity to eat, and we'll deflate with all the food we have in it.
P 280 260.0 280 (Laughter) So if we don't stop ourselves every three or four hours to have a snack, that snowball will deflate in a boisterous way at the first time we have the opportunity to eat, and we'll deflate with all the food around us.
P 282 260.0 282 (Laughter) So if we don't stop ourselves every three, four hours to have a snack, that snowball will defrost in a boraz way at the first moment we have the opportunity to eat, and we'll defrost with all the food around us.
P 284 260.0 284 (Laughter) So if we don't stop ourselves every three, four hours to have a snack, that snowball will defrost in a boraz way at the first moment we have the opportunity to eat, and we'll defrost with all the food around us, in order to finish.
C 286 260.0 286 (Laughter) So if we don't stop ourselves every three, four hours to have a snack, that snowball will vanish at the first moment we have the opportunity to eat, and we will vanish with all the food around us. To finish with this, I want to lie.

P 472 468.0 472 But let's eliminate the mute axis.
P 474 468.0 474 So, let's eliminate the mute axis, where we wrote "A".

P 486 468.0 486 Well, let's eliminate the mute A. There we write an A. But we don't pronounce anything, we don't write anything. It's hard to think what kind of emotional attachment can justify for someone all the burdens that A. causes us.
P 488 468.0 488 So, let's eliminate the mute axis, that's where we write an axis, but we don't pronounce anything, we don't write anything. It's hard to think what kind of emotional attachment can justify for someone all the burdens that the mute axis causes us: beige and beige.
P 490 468.0 490 Well, let's eliminate the mute axis, that's where we write an axis, but we don't pronounce anything, it's not hard to think what kind of emotional attachment can justify for someone all the craziness caused by the mute axis. Long and short, we used to say, "Never."
P 492 468.0 492 So, let's eliminate the mute axis, that's where we write an axis, but we don't pronounce anything, we don't justify anything, I have to think that all the emotional attachments that the mute axis causes us are long and short, as we said before, they never distinguished each other in Spanish.
C 494 468.0 494 Well, let's eliminate mute axis, that's where we write an axis, but we don't pronounce anything, it's not hard to think what kind of emotional attachment can justify all the cracks that mute axis causes us.

P 536 520.0 536 This is an interesting case because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it cannot be an absolute principle. In some cases, differences in pronunciation must be taken into account.
P 538 520.0 538 This is an interesting case because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle. In some cases, differences in pronunciation must be respected, as I said before.

P 542 520.0 542 This is an interesting case, because it shows that the phonological criteria should be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences in pronunciation should be taken into account. Now, I said before, "This is this, in some places it even corresponds to a sound."
P 544 520.0 544 This is an interesting case because it shows us that the phonological criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases the differences in pronunciation must be taken into account. Now, as I said before, this is a set, in some places it corresponds to a sound in other sets of three or two letters.
C 546 520.0 546 This is an interesting case because it shows that the phonological criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, the differences in pronunciation must be taken into account. Now, if I tell you before that this is a seita, in some places it corresponds to a sound, in others it corresponds to two, if we lower it from three letters to two.

P 120 104.0 120 The first one: imagine you go into a gym.
P 122 104.0 122 We are developing, we are filling our minds with powerful ideas, and we are practicing. So there we go, I tell you six ideas that I learned from others to think better. The first one: imagine you enter a gym, looking.
P 124 104.0 124 We've developed it, we've populated our minds with powerful ideas, and we've practiced it. So there we go, I'll tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better. The first one: imagine you enter a gym, look at weightlessness on the floor.
P 126 104.0 126 The first one: imagine you enter a gym, look at the weightlessness on the floor, empty shoes, fixed bicycles.

The first one: imagine you enter a gym, look at the weightlessness on the floor, empty devices, bicycles, fixed ones, you take a half turn.
C 130 104.0 130 The first one: imagine you enter a gym to think better. Look at the weights on the floor, empty apparatus, bicycles, fixed ones, you take a half turn, you go to the bar, you ask for a coffee.

P 140 130.0 140 If I have milk with three half lungs of magnet and they eat it, it doesn't work, otherwise our body doesn't improve with this. Well, thinking about it, the same thing happens.
P 142 130.0 142 It doesn't work if I have milk with three half liters of toothpaste and it doesn't eat, otherwise our body doesn't improve with this. Well, the same thing happens with thinking, it doesn't matter to be able to think.
P 144 130.0 144 It doesn't work if I have milk with three half liters of magnet and you eat it, otherwise our body doesn't improve with this. Well, the same thing happens with thinking, it doesn't matter to be able to think, what matters is to think.

P 148 130.0 148 It doesn't work if we have milk with three half-lenses of magnet that you eat, it doesn't work if not, our body doesn't improve with this. Well, the same thing happens with thinking, it doesn't matter to be able to think, what matters is we have to practice, think, develop ourselves.
P 150 130.0 150 It doesn't work if we have milk with three half-lenses of toothpaste and that's what we eat, it doesn't work if not, our body doesn't improve with this. Well, the same thing happens with thinking, it doesn't count to be able to think, what counts is we have to practice thinking, to develop in ourselves the habit of thinking.
P 152 130.0 152 It doesn't work if we have milk with three half-lenses of toothpaste and we eat it, it doesn't work if not, our body doesn't improve with this.

P 154 130.0 154 It doesn't work if we have milk with three half-lenses of toothpaste and that's it, it doesn't work if not, our body doesn't improve with this. Well, thinking happens the same. It doesn't matter to be able to think, we have to practice, develop the habit of thinking, and we give ourselves the time to think.
C 156 130.0 156 It doesn't work if we have milk with three half magnifying glasses of toothpaste, otherwise our body doesn't improve. Well, thinking doesn't mean being able to think. We have to practice thinking, develop the habit of thinking, and give ourselves the time to think. Intelligence is not something we have or don't have, it's something we have.

P 164 156.0 164 The first one says who you are or what you don't use.
P 166 156.0 166 The second one says, "Who only sees a hammer, doesn't know who else sees it."
P 168 156.0 168 What is used or not? The second one, says the saying, "Who only sees a hammer, who only has a hammer, sees everything."
P 170 156.0 170 It's what we use or don't use. The second one, it's said that those who only see a hammer, those who only have a hammer, see all the problems as a key.
P 172 156.0 172 The second one: the saying goes, "Who only sees a hammer, who only has one, sees all the problems as a key, but if we have to pull out a screw,
P 174 156.0 174 The second one: "Who only sees a hammer, who only has a hammer, sees all the problems as a key, but if we have to remove a hammer, it doesn't work."
P 176 156.0 176 The second one: "Who only sees a hammer, who only has a hammer, sees all the problems as a key, but if we have to remove a hammer, it doesn't work as a hammer, nor do we realize it's a key."
P 178 156.0 178 The second one: "Who only sees a hammer, or who only has a hammer, sees all the problems as a claw, but if we have to remove a hammer, it doesn't work as a hammer, nor do we realize it's a claw. If we have a hammer, we need it.
P 180 156.0 180 The second one: "Who only sees a hammer, or who only has a hammer, sees all the problems without realizing it's not a key, but if we have a hammer, we need a straightener."
C 182 156.0 182 The second one: "Who only sees a hammer, or who only has one, sees all the problems as a hammer, but if we have to take a hammer out of account, it doesn't serve as a key, if we have a hammer, we need a straightener, and if we need to cut something, we need a harness."
P 184 182.0 184 We need to have a safe drawer.
P 186 182.0 186 To have a tool box with more tools.
P 188 182.0 188 Having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things.
P 190 182.0 190 Having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems.
P 192 182.0 192 Having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called modern.
P 194 182.0 194 Having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models.
P 196 182.0 196 I think that having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models.
P 198 182.0 198 I think, having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models. If we only have one mental model, we will think all the problems with that model.
P 200 182.0 200 I guess, having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models. If we only have a mental model, we're going to think all the problems with that model, as if we treat them differently.
P 202 182.0 202 To conclude, having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools are called mental models. If we only have a mental model, we will think of all the problems with that model, as if we were trying to pull out a worm with a brush.
P 204 182.0 204 Having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models. If we only have a mental model, we're going to think of all the problems with that model, as if we were trying to take out a worm with a beetle, if we have many mental models.
P 206 182.0 206 Having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called all the mental models. If we only have one mental model, as if we were trying to take out a worm with a beetle, if we have many mental models, our mind is much more.
C 208 182.0 208 To my mind, having a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models. If we only have one mental model, as if we were trying to pull out all the models with a screw, if we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
