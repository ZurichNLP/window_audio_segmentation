P 160 156.0 160 Because reproductive work has economic value, why does it serve to do other things?

And even more, why don't we do what Herman did, and think that this difference, this contrast between productive work and reproductive work is a difference, more or less infallible, given that it's a difference between men and women.
C 182 156.0 182 to be productive work, because if the workers don't eat, they don't eat in the factory. Now, why does it matter to think about that relative value?

P 262 260.0 262 (Laughter) But what did I think?
P 264 260.0 264 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Haraman" was that:
P 266 260.0 266 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read to Germans is that, precisely, we can also live.
P 268 260.0 268 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Haraman" is that we can also live them in a different way. We can live them in a different way.
P 270 260.0 270 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Alvaran" is that we can also live them in a different way, we can live them as tasks that have to be performed.
P 272 260.0 272 (Laughter) But what I thought when I read "Alvaran" is that we can also live them in a different way, we can live them as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks that have a meaning.

P 40 26.0 40 No more bread, no more sweet, no more puddles, no pastes, every 15 days, roasted, an end in the middle. These foods don't fat. What fattens us up is our body.
P 42 26.0 42 No more bread, no more sweet, no more puddles, no more pasta, every 15 days, sausage, an end in the middle. These foods are not fat. What fats is the mismatch and mismatch between them.
P 44 26.0 44 No more bread, no more sweet, no more puddles, no more pasta, every 15 days, roasted, an end in the middle. These foods don't fat. What fats is the disproportionate and disorganized way in which we consume them.

C 52 26.0 52 No more bread, no more sweet, no more puddles. Pastes, every 15 days. Bread, one on average. These foods don't fat. What fats is the disorganized way in which we consume them. That's why I want to name three key aspects to have a good diet. The first is consciousness.
P 54 52.0 54 (Laughter) "Once upon a time, it's a probe."
P 56 52.0 56 (Laughter) Once a teacher told me, "Take water."
P 58 52.0 58 A teacher once told me, "Awareness is secondary."
P 60 52.0 60 A teacher once told me, "Awareness is secondary to brain activity."
P 62 52.0 62 (Laughter) Once a teacher told me, "Awareness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry, I'm not talking about brain activity.
P 64 52.0 64 One time, a teacher told me: "Awareness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry the experts on the subject, I realized that the brain activity is the most important thing.
P 66 52.0 66 One time, a teacher told me, "Awareness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry the experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious.
P 68 52.0 68 A teacher once told me, "Awareness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry the experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
P 70 52.0 70 One time, a teacher told me, "Awareness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry the experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if awareness is secondary to brain activity, it means that we are not aware of it.
P 72 52.0 72 One time, a teacher told me, "Awareness is secondary to the brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry the experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if consciousness is secondary to our
P 74 52.0 74 A teacher once told me, "Awareness is secondary to the brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry the experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if consciousness is secondary to our desires, we would never choose what to do.
P 76 52.0 76 One time, a teacher told me, "Awareness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry the experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if consciousness is secondary to our desires, we would never choose a food we don't want to eat.
C 78 52.0 78 One time, a teacher told me, "Awareness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry for the experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So if consciousness is secondary to our desires, we would never choose a food we don't want to eat, but on the contrary, the one we like the most.
P 80 78.0 80 And after that, I started to think about it.

P 90 78.0 90 And after this, we are aware of what we are eating, what we are eating and in what amount. A good fact is not going to the supermarket with hunger.
P 92 78.0 92 And after this, we're aware of what we're eating, what we're eating and in what amount. A good fact is not going to the supermarket with hunger. Because when we have to go to the supermarket with hunger, we have to go to the supermarket with hunger.
P 94 78.0 94 And after this, we are aware of what we are eating, what we are eating and in what amount. A good fact is not going to the grocery store hungry, because when we are hungry, it's not apple hunger.

P 98 78.0 98 And after this, we are aware of what we are eating, what we are eating and in what amount. A good fact is to go to the grocery store with hunger, because when we are hungry, it's not apple hunger, it's hunger of everything, it's boracic hunger and the most caloric.
P 100 78.0 100 And after this, we are aware of what we are eating, what we are eating, and in what amount. A good fact is to go to the grocery store with hunger, because when we are hungry, it's not apple hunger, it's hunger of everything, it's hunger for as much as calories. And desire becomes immovable.
P 102 78.0 102 And after this, we are aware of what we are eating, what we are eating, and how much. A good fact is to go to the supermarket with hunger, because when we are hungry, it's not hunger for apples, it's hunger for everything, it's hunger for as much as calories. And desire becomes immovable to that or that food.
C 104 78.0 104 And after this, we are aware of what we are eating, what we are eating, and how much. A good fact is to go to the supermarket with hunger, because when we are hungry, it's not everything, it's hunger for apples, butter and calories, and desire becomes immovable to that or that food we want to eat.
P 106 104.0 106 (Laughter) It's always forbidden.
P 108 104.0 108 (Laughter) It's always been forbidden, it's always been the most tempting.
P 110 104.0 110 has always been the most tempting, or not, the one who makes the most of it.
